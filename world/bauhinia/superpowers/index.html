    <h1>Superpowers in Bauhinia · 紫荆国里的超能力</h1>
    <p class="lighter-text">How Bauhinia treats superpowers.</p>
    <p class="smaller-text">Categories: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/category/lore/">Lore</a></p>
    <p><em>You might wanna read <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/superpowers/">the main superpowers page</a> first!</em></p>
    <p>Bauhinia, being the bureaucratic fanatic it is, have a system of identifying and cataloging people with superpowers (called &quot;the gifted&quot;).</p>
    <p>Each power has a level scale used to measure how strong a person is at that power. They start at 1 (0 meaning &quot;no power&quot; which is always omitted except in specific settings) and have no upper bound.</p>
    <p>A person's power level would change, usually increasing when they're growing up and decreasing when they're growing old. You know, like most normal human body functions.</p>
    <p>Each year during the health examination carried out at schools, the respective hospitals carrying out the exam will do extra tests on the gifted to determine their power level and update records accordingly. As an adult, you can go test if you want, but usually the power level of an adult stays around the same anyways.</p>
    <p>The testing and the determination of levels can be quite subjective sometimes, especially for stuff like mind reading. People could easily fake lower levels, and I doubt the government cares anyways. And when a person's level gets too high, a precise number becomes meaningless.</p>
    <p>On the info section of each character page, you can see their power listed if they have one; and if they're Bauhinian and have taken a test, the level would also be written there. Otherwise it would be &quot;unregistered.&quot;</p>
    <h2 id="mind-reading" tabindex="-1">Mind reading</h2>
    <p>Magicians can enchant helmets to block mind-readers, as stated in the main superpowers file. However, such a thing is banned in Bauhinia, especially <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/flower-city/">Flower City</a>, as the president and the <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/mss/">MSS</a> eavesdroppers want to listen to everyone. This does not prevent people from learning how to mentally shield themselves, however.</p>
    <h2 id="immortality" tabindex="-1">Immortality</h2>
    <p>Immortality does not have levels and is registered when they pop up in DNA tests. Unless the parents are from some rural area and didn't do one properly, or their hospital didn't report it. Even then, people would know you're immortal when you reach something like 120 years old anyways.</p>
    <h2 id="magic" tabindex="-1">Magic</h2>
    <p>Magic has a bit of a history in Bauhinia. During ancient times, the emperors would often call magicians to the capital to serve in the government. They called people with common powers in too, but because the common powers are stored in the soul, it never had an impact on where people with common powers were born. But for magic, flowing in the blood, its origins being a lot of mystery and perhaps a little bit of genetics, the transport of all of them to the south eventually led to most magicians being born in the south. Especially in modern day, more magicians are found in the Republic of Bauhinia than anywhere else.</p>
    <p>The result was that Bauhinia now has an absolute advantage in magic. However, the government, especially <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/kismet/">Kismet</a>, doesn't <em>like</em> that, because he wants not to win the cold war, but to <em>maintain power</em>, which entails <em>prolonging</em> the war. Who knows what's going to happen to the world order if the war ends? He could never be overthrown inside the status quo!</p>
    <p>This led to the Bauhinian government's peculiar attitude on magic. They are simultaneously eager to exploit them for their power and afraid of magicians gaining too much power. The solution was pretty awesome: make them think that instead of something born into them, magic is a <em>privilege</em> — granted by the Bauhinian government.</p>
    <p>This is why as soon as a magician is discovered, they would be required to store their magic inside a vessel &quot;for their own good.&quot; When they grew into adults, they would be required to transfer it to an ID-card look-alike, which is then stored in a government archive, which is exactly what happened to <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/halcyon/">Halcyon</a> after he returned from Moreland.</p>
