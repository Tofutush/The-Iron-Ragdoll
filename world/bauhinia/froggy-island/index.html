    <p><a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/minor/#hyrax">Hyrax</a>'s personal island. He often goes there for vacations, sometimes taking his kids there too (see <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/stories/the-yacht-trip/">The Yacht Trip</a>).</p>
    <h2 id="geography" tabindex="-1">Geography</h2>
    <p>Froggy Island is an island about 50 nautical miles away from <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/coastline/">Coastline</a>, and half as big. It roughly resembles a five-point star.</p>
    <p>It's low on its south, beaches fading into the ocean; and high on its north, the rocks abruptly ending in a cliff. The south-facing tilt made it sunny whenever the sun is out. Beaches surround the southern side of the island, and coconut trees and mangroves grow all around them. The island is practically covered in trees.</p>
    <p>The famous Winter Palace was located near the southern beaches, with the front door facing south.</p>
    <h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History</h2>
    <p>Froggy Island used to be the Bauhinian Emperor's winter retreat, famous for its elaborate Winter Palace. Ever since <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a>'s independence, the Froggy Islanders, like everyone else, dreamed of their own.</p>
    <p>When the Bauhinian Revolution neared an end, a branch of the royal family escaped to the island and moved into the Winter Palace, ruling over the native inhabitants, and hoping to restore the empire. They still said they were the proper government of Bauhinia, and denied the Republic's claim to their territory.</p>
    <p>That was when Hyrax came in. I can assist you in breaking free of the threatening Republican government! He said. The island's inhabitants cheered for him. Of course there were opponents, Republic loyalists or Starcorp-haters (rightfully), but they did not matter in the long run because they were not as influential as Starcorp.</p>
    <p>Hyrax negotiated with the Bauhinian government. About granting Froggy Island independence? Heck no. About purchasing the land all for himself. Not Starcorp-owned; just for Hyrax. It's just like a patch of normal private land, but a lot bigger! I don't see the problem, Mister President! On the other side, he kept Froggy Island wrapped in their dream of independence — and heavens forbid, taking back Bauhinia someday. The Bauhinian government had a choice: either to deny Hyrax the purchase that would set a dangerous precedent in Bauhinia's land regulations, and keep dealing with the annoyingly vocal Froggy Islanders; or to sell it to Hyrax, line their pockets, and let him deal with the people trespassing on his turf.</p>
    <p>They chose the latter. Froggy Island was now Hyrax's private property. The Islanders cheered for their savior, completely unaware of what would happen to them right after: being told to leave. Those who did not comply were shot. Starcorp Militia soldiers drove them out of their homes, destroyed their cities, ruined their lives. Some people — mostly the aforementioned anti-independence Republic loyalists and Starcorp-haters — were quick to declare loyalty to Starcorp, and were spared into a life of servitude (they get paid with… being allowed to live, I guess), maintaining the island to make sure it doesn't collect too much dust when Hyrax was away. While he <em>was</em> on the island for vacations, he made himself at home in the Winter Palace.</p>
    <p>Despite this, a resistance force is gathering on the island… (Ominous ellipsis because I actually don't have an idea clear enough.)</p>
