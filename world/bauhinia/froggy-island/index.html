Hyrax often goes there for vacations, sometimes taking his kids there too. See <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/stories/the-yacht-trip/">The Yacht Trip</a>.</p><h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History</h2><p>Ever since <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a>'s declaration of independence, Froggy Island had been longing for their own independence. Especially so after some remnants of the Imperial Army retreated to the island, claiming themselves the Bauhinian Imperial Government in exile, ruling over the native inhabitants; an effective monarchy. They still said they were the proper government of Bauhinia, and denied the Republic's claim to their territory.</p><p>That was when Hyrax came in. I can assist you in breaking free of the threatening Republican government! He said. The island's inhabitants cheered for him. Of course there were opponents, Republic loyalists or Starcorp-haters (rightfully), but they did not matter in the long run because they were not as influential as Starcorp.</p><p>Hyrax negotiated with the Bauhinian government. About granting Froggy Island independence? Heck no. About purchasing the land all for himself. Not Starcorp-owned; just for Hyrax. It's just like a patch of normal private land, but a lot bigger! I don't see the problem, Mister President! On the other side, he kept Froggy Island wrapped in their dream of independence -- and heavens forbid, taking back Bauhinia someday. The Bauhinian government had a choice: either to deny Hyrax the purchase that would set a dangerous precedent in Bauhinia's land regulations, and keep dealing with the annoyingly vocal Froggy Islanders; or to sell it to Hyrax, line their pockets, and let him deal with the people trespassing on his turf.</p><p>They chose the latter. Froggy Island was now Hyrax's private property. The Islanders cheered for their savior, completely unaware of what would happen to them right after: being told to leave. Those who did not comply were shot. Starcorp Militia soldiers drove them out of their homes, destroyed their cities, ruined their lives. Some people -- mostly the aforementioned anti-independence Republic loyalists and Starcorp-haters -- were quick to declare loyalty to Starcorp, and were spared into a life of servitude (they get paid with… being allowed to live, I guess), maintaining the island to make sure it doesn't collect too much dust when Hyrax was away; and while he <em>was</em> on the island for vacations, he made himself at home in the late emperor's palace.</p></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer-controls"><div id="theme-toggle-wrap"><div id="theme-toggle"><div id="button"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-sun"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"></circle><path d="M12 2v2"></path><path d="M12 20v2"></path><path d="m4.93 4.93 1.41 1.41"></path><path d="m17.66 17.66 1.41 1.41"></path><path d="M2 12h2"></path><path d="M20 12h2"></path><path d="m6.34 17.66-1.41 1.41"></path><path d="m19.07 4.93-1.41 1.41"></path></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-moon"><path d="M12 3a6 6 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1-9-9Z"></path></svg></div></div></div><script src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/js/themeSwitch.js"></script></div><div id="footer-img"><img alt="" title="" class="undefined" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/img/gallery/JO2tEs0_Ba-500.webp" width="500" height="392"></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/quicklink/2.3.0/quicklink.umd.js"></script><script>window.location.href.includes("localhost")||window.addEventListener("load",(()=>{quicklink.listen()}))</script></body></html>
