    <p>Moreland borders <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/westavia/">Westavia</a> to the southwest, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/atlasia/">Atlasia</a> to the southeast, and <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/sylvandia/">Sylvandia</a> to the north.</p>
    <p>The closest geographical mirror to Moreland is Mongolia plus Inner Mongolia.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="government" tabindex="-1">Government</h2>
    <p>Moreland is ruled by a military junta, officially named <em>Armed Forces of the Republic of Moreland</em>, but affectionately referred to by the people as <em>The Guardian Moose</em>, or the &quot;guardians.&quot;</p>
    <p>The leader of the country is called the Supreme Marshall, who heads the Military Council.</p>

    <h3 id="military-service" tabindex="-1">Military service</h3>
    <p>All Moose are required to serve 4 years in the military after graduating high school.</p>
    <p>After those 4 years, if they're eligible (which not a lot of people are), they can stay in the military, which would let them either do what all soldiers to like border patrols or something, or have a chance at getting a government position.</p>
    <p>If they weren't eligible or didn't want to stay in the military, they could get out and get a job or pursue higher education.</p>
    <h3 id="foreign-relations" tabindex="-1">Foreign relations</h3>
    <p>Moreland is in a cold war against <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a>. That is the first thing they like to do.</p>
    <p>The second favorite thing is accusing <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/westavia/">Westavia</a> of being revisionist while denying Westavia's accusation that <em>they</em> are the revisionists. They think Westavia is too poor and stupid; a hopeless child who cannot be anything on their own.</p>
    <h2 id="society" tabindex="-1">Society</h2>
    <h3 id="family" tabindex="-1">Family</h3>
    <p>Family is abolished in Moreland. As soon as the mother had recovered enough and the baby isn't reliant on milk anymore, they get sent to government childcare and the mother goes back to whatever they were doing before. (Unless the mother works in government childcare. Then the kid would be purposefully kept in another childcare center.)</p>
    <h3 id="naming-conventions" tabindex="-1">Naming conventions</h3>
    <p>Since family isn't a thing in Moreland, people don't have family names. In legal settings where precise identification is required, their unique ID number would be written where the family name would be. For example, &quot;<a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/snowball/">Snowball 201710033746</a>.&quot;</p>
    <h3 id="introversion-and-extroversion" tabindex="-1">Introversion and extroversion</h3>
    <p>Morelandian society takes the comfort of introverts very seriously. Your &quot;energy,&quot; which is to say whether you're introverted or extroverted, is a legal identifier assigned to you when you were very young and written on your ID. There are plenty of facilities known as &quot;introvert caves&quot; where people can work quietly without interruption or other human contact. They are always guarded at the entrance by Guardians and you need to show them your ID to be let in.</p>
    <p>Moreland brands itself as a society where people with differing personalities are all given an equal chance to succeed. Introverts are never being pushed to &quot;step out of their comfort zone&quot; and &quot;put themselves out there&quot; to be noticed. They don't show you this data, but nearly everyone at the top of the Guardian Moose are legally extroverts. They claim they're protecting introverts by keeping them locked up in holes and preventing them from doing certain jobs, but it is in fact limiting introverts as a lower, subjugated class.</p>
    <h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History</h2>
    <p>The Morelandian struggle for independence started after the industrial revolution when the surge in productivity had outgrown the relationship between labor and capital and societal conflicts called for new forms of government. In 1930, Morelandians started a bourgeoisie revolution and established a provisional republican government in 1935.</p>
    <p>However, the provisional government engaged in a series of negotiations with the Empire, later referred to as &quot;the Negotiations of Shame,&quot; which aimed at reconciliation with the Empire at the price of Moreland's full autonomy. Maddened by the very un-Moosely cowardice displayed, a group of partisans rose and took over the government in an event later referred to as the Guardian Moose Takeover, which helped establish a truly independent Moose government ruled by a military junta. The three days of the battle to occupy the capital, which was later renamed <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/revolutions-cradle/">Revolution's Cradle</a>, was set as a 3-day long national &quot;day.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bauhinian troops finally withdrew in 1939, after which Moreland began a series of foreign aid, supporting various independence movements in Westavia and Sylvandia. After the independence of Westavia in 1945, Moreland sent troops to Sylvandia to fight against the imperial troops. The fight wasn't as hard as it could've been since a lot of them were called back south to suppress the revolution back home. With the independence of five Sylvandian states that basically covered the entire region, they formed a federal government with the interests of Sylvandians at heart, with the Guardian Moose stationed throughout the new federation to protect them.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Moreland also proxied Westavia in the Atlasian-Westavian war. At the end of the war, they had officially entered a state of cold war against Bauhinia.</p>
    <p>Moreland continued to provide aid to Westavia and Fanton. The aid to Fanton stopped after Bauhinia's invasion war, when they made Fanton finlandized.</p>
