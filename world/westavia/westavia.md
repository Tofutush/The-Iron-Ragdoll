## Geography

Westavia is quite sandy, with some really hot basins surrounded by mountain ranges. Eastern winds don't blow this far into the continent, so the place is dry and deserty. The sunshine made the country suitable for planting grapes.

The closest geographical mirror to Westavia is Xinjiang and Central Asia.

### Cities

Except for the capital, all cities and regions in Westavia are called "Area (number)." Most of the time, these cities had historical names, though referring to them by their historical name is punishable by detainment.

- [People's Vanguard](/world/westavia/peoples-vanguard/)
- [Area 1](/world/westavia/area-1/)
- [Area 3](/world/westavia/area-3/)
- [Area 29](/world/westavia/area-29/)
  - [Nameless Village](/world/westavia/nameless-village/)

## Government

Westavia is a socialist country. There is a central government, and smaller local governments in each city.

### Agencies

- [Suicide Prevention Force](/world/westavia/spf/), the state security apparatus

## Society

Westavians love making wine because they have way too many grapes. And raisins too[^1].

Wine culture is all too big in Westavia. People *love* drinking. Though the legal drinking age is still 18, kids would still drink, and simply mandating an ID check in stores won't work, because most people would have homemade wine right in their homes.

[^1]: Too bad. I hate both raisins and wine.

Kids drinking is a small problem. Westavian adults could drink a ton during gatherings, parties, and even local government meetings, to the point where people could die at the table. The central government had attempted some anti-excessive-drinking campaigns that went nowhere.
