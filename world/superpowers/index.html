    <p>Some people are born with <s>convenient plot devices</s> superpowers. There are some different types of superpowers. You might be either strong or weak in it.</p>
    <p>All common powers are active except for timekeeping, which is passive. More explained in their respective sections.</p>
    <h2 id="common-powers" tabindex="-1">Common powers</h2>
    <p>Common powers are stored in a person's <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/souls/">soul</a>. One soul can only have at most one power, but a person isn't limited to one soul.</p>
    <h3 id="superstrength" tabindex="-1">Superstrength</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/sparky/">Sparky</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/peacock/">Peacock</a></li>
      <li>People with superstrength are called strongpeople<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exactly what it says on the tin. Superstrength means you're born stronger than other people.</p>
    <p>Of course strength is something that can be trained up, and a lack of exercise can make you weak and lame like me, but strongpeople would have more things to them than a normal person who's just strong.</p>
    <p>This power is active, which means that a strongperson has to call upon their power if they want to lift heavy stuff, and that they wouldn't accidentally break things because of their strength. This also means you can catch their unawares.</p>
    <h3 id="timekeeping" tabindex="-1">Timekeeping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/elegance/">Elegance</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/paperweight/">Paperweight</a></li>
      <li>People with timekeeping are called timekeepers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Never be late again! Be able to tell the time down to the second (if you're strong enough). Also be able to tell how much time passed between to certain events.</p>
    <p>This power is passive, so they will always know what time it is or how much time passed as long as they think about it — they don't have to be intentionally summoning their power at the start and end of said event.</p>
    <p>Under duress, a timekeeper's internal clock could be messed up. For example, it's common to mistake their own heartbeat for seconds when timekeepers are panicking.</p>
    <h3 id="hyperawareness" tabindex="-1">Hyperawareness</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/pumpkin/">Pumpkin</a></li>
      <li>People with hyperawareness are called sensors<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be able to see, hear, and smell things that other people can't. For weaker people, they might only get enhanced senses, but for stronger people, they might literally be able to see stuff going on on the other side of town, or hear a pin dropped in a noisy room. It's also possible for someone to be extremely strong in one or two senses but lacking in the others.</p>
    <p>This power is active, which means that a sensor has to be concentrating (and perhaps putting their fingers to their temples or something) to sense stuff.</p>
    <p>There is a special fabric that can conceal a person from sensors. They hate 'em, we love 'em! Of course, you need extra layers of said fabric to hide yourself from stronger sensors.</p>
    <h3 id="invisibility" tabindex="-1">Invisibility</h3>
    <figure class="float-right"><img src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/img/W23F1FQ7H1-200.webp" alt="Goose showing in the mirror" title="Goose showing in the mirror" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="177">
      <figcaption>Goose showing in the mirror</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/goose/">Goose</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/snowball/">Snowball</a></li>
      <li>People with invisibility are called invisibles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Get invisible. Like, that's it. Exactly how much you can get invisible depends on your power strength. Like, weaker people might only get their immediate bodies invisible while their clothes are left hanging in the air; stronger people might be able to get a lot more things near them invisible. But no matter what, they have to be invisible <em>themselves</em> — you can't hide something else but not yourself. Strong invisibles may even make themselves and everything they've hidden pass-through.</p>
    <p>This power is active, obviously. You hide yourself if you want to. Though if someone's been startled, they might subconsciously hide themselves.</p>
    <p>No matter the level, invisible people can always been seen in a mirror, or by a camera. There's also the old trick of pouring flour everywhere.</p>
    <h3 id="mind-reading" tabindex="-1">Mind Reading</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/cosmo/">Cosmo</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/willow/">Willow</a></li>
      <li>People with mind reading are called mind-readers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Look into other people's deepest privacy. Listen in. What are they thinking about? See what they see in their mind's eye. Unless they have aphantasia or something. Hear what they hear in their mind's ear. Including what song is stuck in their head right now.</p>
    <p>That is, if your power is strong enough. Weak mind reading powers are extremely limited. For example, Cosmo can only tell whether people are lying — though she's quite good at that.</p>
    <p>This power is active, which means that a mind-reader has to be concentrating (and perhaps putting their fingers to their temples or something) to read minds. Usually, the one being mind-read would have a tingling sensation in their head, but skilled mind-readers could learn to reduce the effect.</p>
    <p>Everyone can be trained to shield their own thoughts from mind-readers. There is also a special enchanted helmet that can block off mind-readers completely regardless of level, but only magicians can make it. Another type of helmet blocks the ability for mind-readers to read other people's minds. These two types of helmets are different, with the latter being way more common and legal than the former.</p>
    <h2 id="special-powers" tabindex="-1">Special powers</h2>
    <p>These powers are extremely rare, and don't have the boosting and blocking effects that the other five have.</p>
    <p>Technically, a person can have both a common power and a special power — or even both special powers — at the same time as they're not stored in the same place, but this is so rare that no such person might as well exist.</p>
    <h3 id="immortality" tabindex="-1">Immortality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/tundra/">Tundra</a></li>
      <li>People with immortality are called immortals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Get mutilated beyond recognition and still recover with an able body! Literally never die! Except…</p>
    <p>For each immortal there is <em>one</em> thing that can kill them. And you won't know what it is.</p>
    <p>Immortality is stored in the bones, and as such it's the only power that can be detected through medical tests. Since it's in the bones, it comes with the body, unlike the common powers that come with the soul. This is the rarest superpower, followed by magic.</p>
    <h3 id="magic" tabindex="-1">Magic</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/qibli/">Qibli</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/trinket/">Trinket</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/halcyon/">Halcyon</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/nebula/">Nebula</a></li>
      <li>People with magic are called magicians</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, this is the best one of all. Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a>).</p>
    <p>Magicians can do nearly anything they put their minds to. Most of it involve telekinesis, moving and levitating things without touching them; teleportation, moving things — or people — to other places instantly; and all sorts of little gimmicks like changing the words written on a book to prank your friends. The only things magicians can't do is bring dead things back to life, and magically manipulate other people's minds. (They can chop up their brains if they're strong enough though. And able to evade all the cops and live as a wanted fugitive the rest of their lives.)</p>
    <p>Magicians can choose to take their magic out of their body and into a vessel. Then they can only use their magic if they're physically in contact with the vessel. The magic is still theirs, and still only they can use it. But while all other spells function the same, they <em>cannot</em> take the magic back out again unless the vessel is completely broken — for example, snapped in half. Slight chipping doesn't count.</p>
    <p>Magic is stored in the blood, but despite that, normal blood taken out of the body loses its magical properties. Therefore, for a long while it is believed that magic is not transferrable. That is, until Qibli found a way to store tiny bits of it in vessels, allowing other people to use them. But even she is unable to give her magic completely to someone else and make them a magician.</p>
    <h2 id="arch-people" tabindex="-1">Arch-people</h2>
    <p>For each superpower, be it common or special, there will be at most <em>one</em> person alive at the time who will bear the title of Arch-whatever-they-are.</p>
    <p>Arch-people are obviously the most powerful at whatever their superpower is. How this is determined, though, is another matter. If the previous Arch-person had some protege they named, usually their wishes are abided by. But if not, there would be a lot of backs-and-forth between the ISA and other governments.</p>
