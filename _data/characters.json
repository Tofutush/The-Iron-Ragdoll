    "about": "Sparky is a cheerful girl who once stood for something. She hides her trauma behind bright smiles and is almost uncapable of taking anything seriously. Usually she looks happy to other people, but she can turn aggressive at the drop of a pin. She is currently the bodyguard of [Animus](../animus/).\n\nThanks to [Ribbon](/characters/ribbon/) and [her mom](/characters/amber/), she is an excellent chef.\n\nShe's sort of a control freak, especially to the ones she love and fear losing. She also used to harbor naive but beautiful dreams about truth and justice, despite constantly handing out very questionable judgements she isn't supposed to give just because she has power to do so, and always viewing her own understanding as the objective truth. She died in the realization that she grew into exactly the person her younger self used to hate.",
    "trivia": "- She twiddles her whisker-like hair when lying.\n- Tofu is her favorite food. All kinds of them.\n- She loves spicy food.\n- She loves food.\n- If she had a lusus, it would be a jackalope.\n- Her motifs include jackalopes, bunnies, cats, and dancing lions.\n    - This has nothing to do with the character [Jackalope](/characters/jackalope/).\n- If she were ever to have a theme song, it would be titled *Sugar High*.",
    "note": "- The strand of hair on her left cheek is longer, touching on her chin, while the strand on her right cheek is shorter.\n- The highlights on her hair goes down, up, and then down.\n- Her pupils point towards the middle! Unless she's looking at somewhere in particular.\n- Any interaction with Nightsun (romantic or otherwise) *must* be drawn in her adult design; so are bodyguarding activities (with or without Animus)!"

But under his composure, he is a frothing pit of pure rage. He is constantly angry at everything at once but nothing in particular, saddled by the weight of his own guilt and his colleague's suspicion of treason. To people he knows, like [his](/characters/goose/) [subordinates](/characters/pumpkin/), he yells at them all the time. Also he's homophobic as fuck.\n\nHe misses the old times when he could actually run without his knees screaming murder and shoot a gun without his hands shaking. This is why he hates young people — because he's kind of jealous.\n\nHe wishes someone could believe him. He wanted [Whiteout](/characters/whiteout/) back.\n\n---\n\nEveryone in this stupid world is an idiot. Including me.\n\nPumpkin should go fuck his own perverted gay ass! I'd drown him inside a milk tea pool! (Pumpkin: that's a nice way to die actually) Goose can *never* understand human speech. Oh, have the report on my desk by 3, I'd say. She'd flip through the window at 3 in the *fucking morning* and make security piss their pants. Halcyon, would you mind your *own* fucking business? I'm just old; I'm not fucking stupid! You don't have to remind me about that meeting over and over and over — I can keep time better than you could, so shut up!\n\nSigh. Finally some peace and quiet. Med time. Let me take a blood pressure too… Still a little high. Alright.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I could just give up and let myself die. What's the point of living like this, isolated by my colleagues, and shunned by my family? Maybe there exists an afterlife, where I could see *them* again… I could tell her that I'm sorry, and that I tried. I never got to ask him whether he was proud of me.\n\nUgh, Halcyon again. What does that guy want?? He's acting like a mole there with his nose in everyone's businesses. Idiots. All the best people die early. The idiots survive on, alive but not living.\n",

You put the required amount of pills in each box at the start of every week and take the pills as scheduled. He hates it to the guts.",

He extracts them, locks them up in a jar, and sends the freshly-drained body to cremation. It's also the reason why he met Frosting, the archivist who handles the soul jars.\n\nAt work, he pulls up a stoic and serious face to hide his emotions. To his friends and family, though, he's a scaredy-cat. He screams at the tiniest of bugs and have to have Frosting deal with them. He jumps at the slightest sound.\n\nHe believes whole-heartedly that the government has a chip in his brain to monitor his thoughts.\n\n---\n\nPeople will tell you that bodies without souls are just corpses. I know it's false. They are very much alive. They can live on for around a week. And guess what? For the first few days, the soul — if it had not found a new body — can still feel the old body. I found out during my soul-extraction training, when my friend and I pulled each other's soul out in turn for fun. Which means, the condemned can feel their body being burned to ashes.\n\nI try to live with the knowledge. That they will suffer the fire, that *I* enabled it, and that most of the time, their crimes aren't serious enough to warrant permanent death where even reincarnation, birthing as an *entirely new* soul, is not allowed. *Nothing* warrants that—\n\nStop thinking! *Stop thinking*, you stupid brain! Don't think — no, not the chip, don't think about it — Of course the government has their reasons! Some people *are* evil enough that there's no place in the world for them. Who am I to disagree? Right. Just do your job. Stop thinking about that. Think about your wife and daughter.\n\nI take a deep breath, and I stop thinking."
