    "about": "Sparky is a cheerful girl who once stood for something. She hides her trauma behind bright smiles and is almost uncapable of taking anything seriously. Usually she looks happy to other people, but she can turn aggressive at the drop of a pin. She is currently the bodyguard of [Animus](/characters/animus/).\n\nThanks to [Ribbon](/characters/ribbon/) and [her mom](/characters/amber/), she is an excellent chef.\n\nShe's sort of a control freak, especially to the ones she love and fear losing. She also used to harbor naive but beautiful dreams about truth and justice, despite constantly handing out very questionable judgements she isn't supposed to give just because she has power to do so, and always viewing her own understanding as the objective truth.\n\nShe came into contact with [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/) when her dad died and her mom married [Peacock](/characters/peacock/). Her awakening came upon discovering just a tiny part of Starcorp's horrid crimes ([Pearl](/stories/new-year-2032/)), and [failing to defy them](/stories/pearls-journey-home-sylvandia/).\n\nAfter being informed that her mom died, her hatred towards Starcorp and Peacock reached a peak. She investigated, but came to a desperately hopeful conclusion: that Peacock was trying to disassemble Starcorp from the insides.\n\nShe stopped hating him, and instead vowed to take the same path he did. She feigned loyalty towards Starcorp, and accepted the adults' plan for her to become Animus's bodyguard, the closest protector of the future chairman. In that position, she could surely take down Starcorp from the inside.\n\nBut as she reaped the fruit of being at the top of society, she couldn't help but feel that the loyalty may be real after all.\n\nShe died in the realization that she grew into exactly the person her younger self used to hate. Not ready to let go, she spat out [Meng Po](/world/meng-po/)'s soup behind her back and traveled to her [next life](/characters/peacock/) with all her memories intact…",
    "trivia": "- She twiddles her whisker-like hair when lying.\n- Tofu is her favorite food. All kinds of them.\n- She loves spicy food.\n- She loves food.\n- If she had a lusus, it would be a jackalope.\n- Her motifs include jackalopes, bunnies, cats, and dancing lions.\n    - This has nothing to do with the character [Jackalope](/characters/jackalope/).\n- Song: [你哪个省的？](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1GDtvzVE8F/) (Parody of [裏表ラバーズ](https://youtu.be/b_cuMcDWwsI?si=s3Ka2daE4kp6abNe))\n- If she were ever to have a *dedicated* theme song, it would be titled *Sugar High*.",
    "note": "- The strand of hair on her left cheek is longer, touching on her chin, while the strand on her right cheek is shorter.\n- The highlights on her hair goes down, up, and then down.\n- Her pupils point towards the middle! Unless she's looking at somewhere in particular.\n- Any interaction with Nightsun (romantic or otherwise) *must* be drawn in her adult design; so are bodyguarding activities (with or without Animus)!"

She dedicated her spare time to seeking revenge from Qibli.\n\nTo do so, she hired private detective [Melody](/characters/melody/), who found his good cop buddy [Tephra](/characters/tephra/).\n\nIn the end, they caught Qibli (see [Qibli on the Run](/stories/qibli-on-the-run/)).\n\nTrinket's behavior shown in her dedication to catching Qibli satisfied Kismet.

Because of this, he came up with the idea (or rather, Hyrax learned that Kismet would do this and Kismet did) of [eternal death](/world/bauhinia/#eternal-death), to prevent people from reincarnating, let alone with memory.\n\nAfter acquiring Tundra's body, he needed stand-ins for himself in public appearances, and thus [Project Kismet](/stories/project-kismet/) was initiated.",

That is, until one day, she was approached by government agents giving her an offer she can't refuse.\n\nHer kids would be guaranteed spots at Bauhinia's top institutions and offered comfortable and well-paid jobs, but Pinecone herself would also be working a secret job that forbids her from seeing her children in person again. She will be trained adequately in her new job. They have been watching her for quite a while and they know she can do it.\n\nPinecone had to agree. She was then taken to a plastic surgeon, hairdresser, and all that; and by the time she got out she looked no longer like herself, but rather like… the president of Bauhinia, Kismet. She even had a throat implant that changed her voice to his.\n\nThat was the job. She would stand in for him during public appearances. Otherwise, she had all the time to herself, though she could not leave the government building nor contact anyone outside, except for calling her kids each once a week, and she had to strictly not mention her job to them. Her younger child, Firecrackers, couldn't even be called at all because he's mute so even if she did call him, he couldn't say anything over the phone. She just left voice messages.\n\nPinecone is grateful. She is living in a fancy palace and has delicious and nutritious meals every day. Though, sometimes the fear of fucking up and causing an international scandal got too great and she was scared of facing the numerous cameras and journalists. But then, Rosemary will always be there to comfort her.\n\n*This is the best job in the world; you're lucky. Other people wouldn't dream of getting it.*"

It's also the reason why he met Frosting, the archivist who handles the soul jars.\n\nAt work, he pulls up a stoic and serious face to hide his emotions. To his friends and family, though, he's a scaredy-cat. He screams at the tiniest of bugs and have to have Frosting deal with them. He jumps at the slightest sound.\n\nHe believes whole-heartedly that the government has a chip in his brain to monitor his thoughts.\n\n---\n\nPeople will tell you that bodies without souls are just corpses. I know it's false. They are very much alive. They can live on for around a week. And guess what? For the first few days, the soul — if it had not found a new body — can still feel the old body. I found out during my soul-extraction training, when my friend and I pulled each other's soul out in turn for fun. Which means, the condemned can feel their body being burned to ashes.\n\nI try to live with the knowledge. That they will suffer the fire, that *I* enabled it, and that most of the time, their crimes aren't serious enough to warrant permanent death where even reincarnation, birthing as an *entirely new* soul, is not allowed. *Nothing* warrants that—\n\nStop thinking! *Stop thinking*, you stupid brain! Don't think — no, not the chip, don't think about it — Of course the government has their reasons! Some people *are* evil enough that there's no place in the world for them. Who am I to disagree?

That was when the Guardian Moose found her. They sent her to a hospital and had her bad leg amputated, and thus her life was spared. The Guardians then offered to recruit her as their wilderness survival instructor, to which she agreed. She was given Moose nationality.\n\nShe was soon hailed as a devil by the new recruits for her strictness and the intensity of her training. Years later, they also got her a prosthetic leg, which made the newbies even more scared because now she can kick them properly. Jinx remembers her torment and thanked the stars that Typhoon didn't have the robot leg while she was in the army.",

She created characters inside the real world, and took pride in the detailed research she does in the real world that made her OCs more realistic.\n\nWhen the war broke out, trade between the two nations were nearly all cut off, and Jumbo found herself without any source of income. But the connections she established with Fantoni traders weren't going anywhere. She tried to offer to work for the MSS, but got rejected. And then she suddenly got a tiny bit of actual Bauhinian intel (details TBD), so she tried her luck again with the Fantoni, using that intel as a buy-in. They recruited her.\n\nJumbo then realized that she had no way of actually gathering useful intel, so she simply made shit up. When inconsistencies were found out by the National Security Agency of Fanton, she made up fake contacts based on her OCs to shift the blame to.\n\nSlowly, due to shit tradecraft, her messages to the Fanton military got intercepted by the MSS. They had a good laugh about how stupid this was, and realized that the Fantoni Secret Service trusted Jumbo a lot. Here comes the chance. Sky went to Jumbo and gave her a choice. She can either go to jail for treason, or she can start working for the MSS, giving the Fantoni Secret Service some specific fake intel provided to her. The choice was obvious. Jumbo finally got to work for the MSS now.\n\nAfter the war was over, Jumbo was too burnt out to ever consider making OCs again. She moved to northeastern Bauhinia to do trade with Atlasia."

She stayed in Bauhinia after the war, still working minimum-wage jobs, but getting a pension from the MSS and getting high a lot more safely.

She was supposed to cast it by tapping its butt in a certain rhythm near an important fiber-optic line in Bauhinia.\n\nBlackjack landed in Bauhinia, only to be soon caught by the MSS. Sky came in and gave her an offer: work for the MSS, and we will provide you with a proper, well-paying job in Bauhinia.\n\nBlackjack accepted the offer. She was sent back to Fanton with fake news about the cable being destroyed, and a new mission to find out the source of the magic. But she got caught and imprisoned.\n\nRight as the war was ending, Sky came to Fanton personally to blackmail the military official who imprisoned her. She was released back into Bauhinia.\n\nAfter the war, she got her promised job as a martial arts instructor at a high school. She found herself longing for adventure once more, being bored out by the rigid predictiveness of life in the light.",
