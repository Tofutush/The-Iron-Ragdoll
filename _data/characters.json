After the entire Hillslope thing she started getting scared of anything being out of her control. She also harbored naive but beautiful dreams about truth and justice.

    "about": "Paperweight is a senior officer at the [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/).\n\nHe usually maintains a very calm and authoritative composure to others, especially the people he deals with at work — spies, moles, and pesky annoying kids. But under his composure, he is a frothing pit of pure rage. He is constantly angry at everything at once but nothing in particular, saddled by the weight of his own guilt and his colleague's suspicion of treason. To people he knows, like [his](/characters/goose/) [subordinates](/characters/pumpkin/), he yells at them all the time. Also he's homophobic as fuck.\n\nHe misses the old times when he could actually run without his knees screaming murder and shoot a gun without his hands shaking. This is why he hates young people — because he's kind of jealous.\n\nHe wishes someone could believe him. He wanted [Whiteout](/characters/whiteout/) back.\n\n---\n\nEveryone in this stupid world is an idiot. Including me.\n\nPumpkin should go fuck his own perverted gay ass! I'd drown him inside a milk tea pool! (Pumpkin: that's a nice way to die actually) Goose can *never* understand human speech. Oh, have the report on my desk by 3, I'd say. She'd flip through the window at 3 in the *fucking morning* and make security piss their pants. Halcyon, would you mind your *own* fucking business? I'm just old; I'm not fucking stupid! You don't have to remind me about that meeting over and over and over — I can keep time better than you could, so shut up!\n\nSigh. Finally some peace and quiet. Med time. Let me take a blood pressure too… Still a little high. Alright.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I could just give up and let myself die. What's the point of living like this, isolated by my colleagues, and shunned by my family? Maybe there exists an afterlife, where I could see *them* again… I could tell her that I'm sorry, and that I tried. I never got to ask him whether he was proud of me.\n\nUgh, Halcyon again. What does that guy want?? He's acting like a mole there with his nose in everyone's businesses. Idiots. All the best people die early. The idiots survive on, alive but not living.\n",

Otherwise, it stays open, even when she's sleeping. (It closes when she washes her face too though, or it's gonna be awkward.)",

It's also the reason why he met Frosting, the archivist who handles the soul jars.\n\nAt work, he pulls up a stoic and serious face to hide his emotions. To his friends and family, though, he's a scaredy-cat. He screams at the tiniest of bugs and have to have Frosting deal with them. He jumps at the slightest sound.\n\nHe believes whole-heartedly that the government has a chip in his brain to monitor his thoughts.\n\n---\n\nPeople will tell you that bodies without souls are just corpses. I know it's false. They are very much alive. They can live on for around a week. And guess what? For the first few days, the soul — if it had not found a new body — can still feel the old body. I found out during my soul-extraction training, when my friend and I pulled each other's soul out in turn for fun. Which means, the condemned can feel their body being burned to ashes.\n\nI try to live with the knowledge. That they will suffer the fire, that *I* enabled it, and that most of the time, their crimes aren't serious enough to warrant permanent death where even reincarnation, birthing as an *entirely new* soul, is not allowed. *Nothing* warrants that—\n\nStop thinking! *Stop thinking*, you stupid brain! Don't think — no, not the chip, don't think about it — Of course the government has their reasons! Some people *are* evil enough that there's no place in the world for them. Who am I to disagree? Right. Just do your job. Stop thinking about that. Think about your wife and daughter.\n\nI take a deep breath, and I stop thinking."
