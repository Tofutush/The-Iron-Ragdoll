She is currently the bodyguard of [Animus](../animus/).\n\nThanks to [Ribbon](/characters/ribbon/) and [her mom](/characters/amber/), she is an excellent chef.\n\nShe's sort of a control freak, especially to the ones she love and fear losing. She also used to harbor naive but beautiful dreams about truth and justice, despite constantly handing out very questionable judgements she isn't supposed to give just because she has power to do so, and always viewing her own understanding as the objective truth. She died in the realization that she grew into exactly the person her younger self used to hate.",

What's the point of living like this, isolated by my colleagues, and shunned by my family? Maybe there exists an afterlife, where I could see *them* again… I could tell her that I'm sorry, and that I tried. I never got to ask him whether he was proud of me.\n\nUgh, Halcyon again.

Because of this, he came up with the idea (or rather, Hyrax learned that Kismet would do this and Kismet did) of [eternal death](/world/bauhinia/#eternal-death), to prevent people from reincarnating, let alone with memory.\n\nAfter acquiring Tundra's body, he needed stand-ins for himself in public appearances, and thus [Project Kismet](/stories/project-kismet/) was initiated.",

That is, until one day, she was approached by government agents giving her an offer she can't refuse.\n\nHer kids would be guaranteed spots at Bauhinia's top institutions and offered comfortable and well-paid jobs, but Pinecone herself would also be working a secret job that forbids her from seeing her children in person again. She will be trained adequately in her new job. They have been watching her for quite a while and they know she can do it.\n\nPinecone had to agree. She was then taken to a plastic surgeon, hairdresser, and all that; and by the time she got out she looked no longer like herself, but rather like… the president of Bauhinia, Kismet. She even had a throat implant that changed her voice to his.\n\nThat was the job. She would stand in for him during public appearances. Otherwise, she had all the time to herself, though she could not leave the government building nor contact anyone outside, except for calling her kids each once a week, and she had to strictly not mention her job to them. Her younger child, Firecrackers, couldn't even be called at all because he's mute so even if she did call him, he couldn't say anything over the phone. She just left voice messages.\n\nPinecone is grateful. She is living in a fancy palace and has delicious and nutritious meals every day. Though, sometimes the fear of fucking up and causing an international scandal got too great and she was scared of facing the numerous cameras and journalists. But then, Rosemary will always be there to comfort her.\n\n*This is the best job in the world; you're lucky. Other people wouldn't dream of getting it.*"

It's also the reason why he met Frosting, the archivist who handles the soul jars.\n\nAt work, he pulls up a stoic and serious face to hide his emotions. To his friends and family, though, he's a scaredy-cat. He screams at the tiniest of bugs and have to have Frosting deal with them. He jumps at the slightest sound.\n\nHe believes whole-heartedly that the government has a chip in his brain to monitor his thoughts.\n\n---\n\nPeople will tell you that bodies without souls are just corpses. I know it's false. They are very much alive. They can live on for around a week. And guess what? For the first few days, the soul — if it had not found a new body — can still feel the old body. I found out during my soul-extraction training, when my friend and I pulled each other's soul out in turn for fun. Which means, the condemned can feel their body being burned to ashes.\n\nI try to live with the knowledge. That they will suffer the fire, that *I* enabled it, and that most of the time, their crimes aren't serious enough to warrant permanent death where even reincarnation, birthing as an *entirely new* soul, is not allowed. *Nothing* warrants that—\n\nStop thinking! *Stop thinking*, you stupid brain! Don't think — no, not the chip, don't think about it — Of course the government has their reasons! Some people *are* evil enough that there's no place in the world for them. Who am I to disagree? Right. Just do your job. Stop thinking about that. Think about your wife and daughter.\n\nI take a deep breath, and I stop thinking.",

The Guardians then offered to recruit her as their wilderness survival instructor, to which she agreed.

    "about": "Jumbo was just a small trader living near the Fantoni border, trading stuff between Bauhinia and Fanton, mostly staying within the bounds of the law. She loved making OCs based around real-life places in the world too.\n\nWhen the war broke out, trade between the two nations were nearly all cut off, and Jumbo found herself without any source of income. But the connections she established with Fantoni traders weren't going anywhere. She tried to offer to work for the MSS, but got rejected. And then she suddenly got a tiny bit of actual Bauhinian intel (details TBD), so she tried her luck again with the Fantoni, using that intel as a buy-in. They recruited her.\n\nJumbo then realized that she had no way of actually gathering useful intel, so she simply made shit up. When inconsistencies were found out by the National Security Agency of Fanton, she made up fake contacts based on her OCs to shift the blame to.\n\nSlowly, due to shit tradecraft, her messages to the Fanton military got intercepted by the MSS. They had a good laugh about how stupid this was, and realized that the NSA trusted Jumbo a lot. Here comes the chance. Sky went to Jumbo and gave her a choice. She can either go to jail for treason, or she can start working for the MSS, giving the NSA some specific fake intel provided to her. The choice was obvious. Jumbo finally got to work for the MSS now.\n\nAfter the war was over, Jumbo was in a comfortable position. Her salary from the NSA got her through the high wartime utility prices, and she saved up most of her MSS salary, plus they still gave her a monthly pension. She stopped hopping borders constantly, only doing some occasional freelancing, and focused on making her OCs. She planned to publish a novel about them, and had been writing Chapter 1 over and over again for years."

    "about": "Mulberry was a rebellious young college drop-out who longed for the illicit substances banned by her home country. When she was not working at the grocery store, she spent her time on the streets, finding places to buy smokes and drinks.\n\nWhen the war broke out, she was drafted by the army, but offered to spy on Bauhinia for the NSA to avoid actually getting on the battlefield. Nearly as soon as she landed inside the country she turned herself in to the MSS. Sky got her to send fake intel to the NSA. She stayed in Bauhinia after the war, still working minimum-wage jobs, but getting a pension from the MSS and getting high a lot more safely. (Safe as in the law won't get her; it's still very unhealthy. Don't do drugs.)"

    "about": "Blackjack was a Fantoni underground mobster before the war, running her own team of gangsters. She also had some \"friends\" in the government who would cover for her in exchange for bribes.\n\nHer business should've been booming because of the war, but one of her government pals asked her for a bigger protection fee — run a little spying job in Bauhinia.\n\nThinking her underground dealing skills amounted to tradecraft, Blackjack landed in Bauhinia, only to be soon caught by the MSS. Sky came in and gave her an offer: execution, or working for the MSS.\n\nBlackjack chose the latter. She was sent back to Fanton with some fake intel intended to fool the government official who asked for it. She would then go do some sabotage stuff ig\n\nAfter the war had ended, Blackjack was in danger of being found out. Sky staged a rescue mission to smuggle her into Bauhinia, where she lived on as a martial arts instructor."
