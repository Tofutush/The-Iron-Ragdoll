      <p>Sparky is a cheerful girl who once stood for something. She hides her trauma behind bright smiles and is almost uncapable of taking anything seriously. Usually she looks happy to other people, but she can turn aggressive at the drop of a pin. She is currently the bodyguard of <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/animus/">Animus</a>.</p>
      <p>Thanks to <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/ribbon/">Ribbon</a> and <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/amber/">her mom</a>, she is an excellent chef.</p>
      <p>She's sort of a control freak, especially to the ones she love and fear losing. She also used to harbor naive but beautiful dreams about truth and justice, despite constantly handing out very questionable judgements she isn't supposed to give just because she has power to do so, and always viewing her own understanding as the objective truth.</p>
      <p>She came into contact with <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/starcorp/">Starcorp</a> when her dad died and her mom married <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/peacock/">Peacock</a>. Her awakening came upon discovering just a tiny part of Starcorp's horrid crimes (<a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/stories/new-year-2032/">Pearl</a>), and <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/stories/pearls-journey-home-sylvandia/">failing to defy them</a>.</p>
      <p>After being informed that her mom died, her hatred towards Starcorp and Peacock reached a peak. She investigated, but came to a desperately hopeful conclusion: that Peacock was trying to disassemble Starcorp from the insides.</p>
      <p>She stopped hating him, and instead vowed to take the same path he did. She feigned loyalty towards Starcorp, and accepted the adults' plan for her to become Animus's bodyguard, the closest protector of the future chairman. In that position, she could surely take down Starcorp from the inside.</p>
      <p>But as she reaped the fruit of being at the top of society, she couldn't help but feel that the loyalty may be real after all.</p>
      <p>She died in the realization that she grew into exactly the person her younger self used to hate. Not ready to let go, she spat out <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/meng-po/">Meng Po</a>'s soup behind her back and traveled to her <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/peacock/">next life</a> with all her memories intact…</p>

        <h3><a class="rel-h3" href="../amber/">Amber</a> (mother)</h3>
        <p>Sparky loves Amber almost obsessively. She always demands to know everything about what her mom is doing. If Amber's whereabouts are unknown to Sparky for even a split second, Sparky would worry that something happened to her mom, because she's terrified of losing her. It was tiring for Amber, like raising a sentient surveillance camera. She preferred <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/willow/">Willow</a>.</p>
        <p>Sparky's longing for Jackal also irritated Amber, because for all Sparky knew, Jackal was neither a good dad nor a good husband. But Amber doesn't know how to break it to her.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3><a class="rel-h3" href="../peacock/">Peacock</a> (stepfather)</h3>
        <p>Peacock is Sparky's step-father <s>and reincarnation</s>. Sparky hates him because he didn't match up to the perfect father (Jackal) in her mind.</p>
        <p>Peacock, on the other hand, is deep in conflict as he both hates who he was in the past, but also desperately wants to <em>be</em> who he was in the past.</p>

        <h3><a class="rel-h3" href="../willow/">Willow</a> (younger half-sister)</h3>
        <p>Sparky and Willow have the <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/amber/">same mother</a> but different fathers. Willow is the one who understands Sparky the most, because of her mind-reading; but she has a hard time expressing how she felt about Sparky, especially with her being so irritable.</p>
        <p>After Amber died and before Peacock sent Sparky to Fancy Private School, Sparky had to walk Willow there every day. At first she made it extremely clear that she blamed Peacock's entire blood-related family for Amber's death, but slowly she took a liking towards Willow.</p>
        <p>After Willow's fiasco with Sundae, Sparky shut herself into the closet.</p>

        <p>Sparky got assigned to sit next to Sky on their first day of <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/cms/">Middle School</a>. The stuff he did — twirl cards, take photos, being able to recognize any sort of tank at one glance — fascinated her. Though she wouldn't admit it, she had a little crush on him. The crush later turned to a big crush on <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/nightsun/">Nightsun</a>.</p>
        <p>As for Sky, he is always looking for new friends.</p>

        <h3><a class="rel-h3" href="../firecrackers/">Firecrackers</a> (friend)</h3>
        <p>What's the difference between their cursing? Sparky does it unconsciously; she treats curses like like normal words. But Firecrackers curses intentionally, just to piss people off.</p>
        <p>Sparky had always whether intentionally or unintentionally tried to offer Firecrackers money, be it spare change or buying a lot of stuff at his parents' store, for which they need to pay Starcorp rent. Sparky had tried and failed to convince Peacock to lower rent for Firecrackers specifically.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Nightsun used to be a no-names <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/starcorp/">Starcorp</a> employee in the headquarters in Coastline. Sparky developed a huge crush on him and kept trying to get close to him despite warnings from Animus. After <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/fantasy/">Fantasy</a> died and <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/bramble/">Bramble</a> became her child, she proposed to Nightsun and they got married.</p>
        <p>Once they got married, Sparky started to exert control over him like she did everyone. She made Nightsun quit his job and stay at home to take care of Bramble. He did, so now Bramble likes him (&quot;papa!&quot;) more than he likes Sparky (&quot;auntie&quot;), and now she's mad about it.</p>
        <p>Little did she know, Nightsun was a spy sent to get information on Animus. After Animus found out, Sparky refused to let anything happen to Nightsun because she still loved him, and believed that he reciprocated, and also Bramble liked him too much. Animus decided to feed false information through Nightsun, though he didn't want Nightsun to know. Sparky, however, came clean to him about running him as a double agent.</p>
        <p>Nightsun agreed, because deep down, he loved Sparky too.</p>

She really did care about Bramble. Now I wonder where I've seen this before... Ah yes, Sparky calling Peacock &quot;Peacock.&quot;</p>
        <p>Bramble also constantly pesters Sparky into telling him what happened to <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/fantasy/">his mom</a>, because &quot;Auntie knows <em>everything</em>!&quot; Truth is, Sparky would also very much like to know what happened to Fantasy.</p>

Colt 1911 (didn't the <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/history/">industrial revolution</a> <em>just</em> break out in 1911? Whatever I don't care).

              <p>The letters at the end spells out &quot;sbarki&quot; in Uyghurche! I've only gotten so far as the alphabet and some basic words, haha. I do hope one day I'll be able to actually translate stuff into the language. (Meanwhile, French: You're leaving me behind?? Sorry learning one language hard enough I can't do two at the same time lmao.)</p>
