When you die normally, you will walk along the "yellow spring" road beside the "forget everything" river, until you come to the "I can't do anything about it" bridge. On the bridge there is a lady called Meng Po who is constantly brewing her Meng Po Soup, which she makes you drink and wipes out your memory. You then move on to your next life, with no burden of the memories of your previous.

There will only be one person on the bridge at any given time. From Meng Po's perspective, people appear one immediately after the other, not in chronological order of their time of death, but in the order of reincarnation. To illustrate:

Sparky reincarnated into Peacock. After Meng Po had greeted Sparky on the bridge, she will see Peacock next. After that, she will see the person that Peacock reincarnated into. Every person in the world is essentially the same person reincarnated over and over.

Everyone will eventually reincarnate, immortal or not. The souls inside Kismet's soul vault, though reincarnation delayed, will eventually disperse once the vault was freed. Nothing lasts forever.
