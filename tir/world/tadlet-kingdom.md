It's a world full of huge, talking tadlets living inside kingdoms. The two main kingdoms are Cat Kingdom and Dog Kingdom.

## Meta

(Contrast with [Qibli's pocket dimension](/stories/qibli-on-the-run/#pocket-dimension).)

Sunflower can enter her paracosm, normally by flushing herself down a toilet, but any method works actually, as long as you know about it and intend to enter. She just likes the absurdity.

Real time passes when you are inside, though not always linearly, so it's best to keep a watch on you. It tells you what time it is outside.

You are not actually inside — your physical body is still in the real world, sitting on that toilet; and that's how you can still connect to the real world like your watch displaying the correct time or phone connecting to the internet.

The things inside the paracosm depends wholly on Sunflower's imagination, though the talking tadlets don't need Sunflower's active thinking to do stuff — like they have sentience (they don't *really* have sentience though, they aren't real).
