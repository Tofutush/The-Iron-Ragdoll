Where most of the story takes place! A large city on the southern coast of [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), where [Starcorp](../starcorp/)'s headquarters is located.

Having bore no significance during all these ages throughout the history of the Empire, it quickly rose in status after the rise of Starcorp, and became the economic center and largest port in Bauhinia. Coastline prides itself in Starcorp, with museums detailing the company's history and all that, for without it Coastline is nothing.
