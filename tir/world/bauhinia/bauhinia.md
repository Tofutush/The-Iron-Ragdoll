Bau-HEE-nee-a: the pink bureaucratic fanatic[^1].

The bauhinia flower is the national symbol of Bauhinia[^2].

## Geography

Bauhinia borders [Fanton](/world/fanton/) on the northwest and [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) on the north.

Bauhinia is in the south of the continent, with most of its territory being in the sub-tropics. Bauhinia trees grow throughout the country.

The country experiences monsoons that blow from the southeast in summer and the southwest in winter. For the northern parts of the country though, [Fanton](/world/fanton/) blocks out most of the southwestern wind.

The closest geographical mirror to Bauhinia is southern China.

### Places

- [Flower City](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/) (capital)
- [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/)
- [Froggy Island](/world/bauhinia/froggy-island/)

## Government

Bauhinia is a ministerial republic with an avid love for bureaucracy. The government primarily serves the interests of the bourgeoisie[^3], which kind of only involves [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), with which it is in a mutually beneficial and balanced relationship, with Starcorp making sure the government stays in power and the government making sure Starcorp dominates in the economy.

Bauhinia is also a dictatorship, in case you haven't noticed. It's on a happy-go-lucky seesaw between liberalism and fascism — sometimes it's really liberal and not so fascist, while sometimes it's really fascist and not so liberal. Last time the seesaw hit the bottom of the fascist side, Bauhinia invaded Fanton.

### Ministries

- [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/)
- Ministry of Health, responsible for [superpowers testing](/world/bauhinia/superpowers/)

### Foreign relations

Bauhinia is in a cold war against [Moreland](/world/moreland/). They have also finlandized and attempted to annex [Fanton](/world/fanton/), an attempt which failed but made Fanton take their side in the cold war. They engage in exploitive activities in [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/) not unlike that of Moreland's.

## Economy

Bauhinia is controlled by a huge company called [Starcorp](starcorp/) that nearly monopolizes every industry in the country.

The wealth gap is really damn big.

Bauhinia is a major importer of agricultural produce from places like [Fanton](/world/fanton/) and [Westavia](/world/westavia/), and an exporter of processed products.

I don't really understand economics enough.

## Society

Everyone is batshit crazy in Bauhinia.

Bauhinia emphasizes love, empathy, harmony, and family. Too bad it's actually full of hate, apathy, discord, and [single dads raising 4 kids each with different bio parents](/characters/peacock/). (The [oldest one](/characters/fantasy/) is an adult now though so she doesn't count.)

### Naming conventions

The name of a Bauhinian (or [Fantoni](/world/fanton/)) consists of three parts: the given name, and the parents' given names.

For girls, their names would be given name + mother's given name + father's given name. For example, "[Sparky](/characters/sparky/) [Amber](/characters/amber/) [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)."

For boys, their names would be given name + father's given name + mother's given name. For example, "[Tundra](/characters/tundra/) Eagle Starlight."

When your legal guardians change, they can apply for a name change for you. Sparky's name was Sparky Amber Jackal before Peacock became her stepdad. [Fantasy](/characters/fantasy/) also had her name changed from Fantasy Rainbow Peacock to Fantasy Amber Peacock. But [Ironheart](/characters/ironheart/) remained as Ironheart Peacock Reindeer because Amber had already died by the time he moved in with Peacock.

## History

See: [History](/world/history/)

Bauhinia used to be a huge empire spanning across almost the entire continent. That was why everyone spoke the same language, totally not because I'm too lazy.

The industrialization of Bauhinia eventually led to a republican revolution where the emperor was overthrown, and the empire collapsed as other countries declared their independencies. After the end of the Atlasian / Westavian War, Bauhinia entered a cold war with Moreland, splitting the continent into the north and the south.

[Fanton](/world/fanton/) took a nominally neutral (though finlandized) stance at the beginning of the cold war, but later Bauhinia launched an invasion which failed to annex Fanton but made them take their side.

Most of the story takes place during the cold war.
