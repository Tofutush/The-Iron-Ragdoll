## Geography

Bauhinia borders [Fanton](/world/fanton/) on the northwest and [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) on the north.

Bauhinia is in the south of the continent, with most of its territory being in the sub-tropics. Bauhinia trees grow throughout the country.

The country experiences monsoons that blow from the southeast in summer and the southwest in winter. For the northern parts of the country though, [Fanton](/world/fanton/) blocks out most of the southwestern wind.

The closest geographical mirror to Bauhinia is southern China.

### Places

- [Flower City](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/) (capital)
- [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/)
- [Froggy Island](/world/bauhinia/froggy-island/)

## Government

Bauhinia is a ministerial republic with an avid love for bureaucracy. The government primarily serves the interests of the bourgeoisie, which kind of only involves [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), with which it is in a mutually beneficial and balanced relationship, with Starcorp making sure the government stays in power and the government making sure Starcorp dominates in the economy.

Bauhinia is also a dictatorship, in case you haven't noticed. It's on a happy-go-lucky seesaw between liberalism and fascism — sometimes it's really liberal and not so fascist, while sometimes it's really fascist and not so liberal. Last time the seesaw hit the bottom of the fascist side, Bauhinia invaded Fanton.

### Ministries

- [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/)
- Ministry of Health, responsible for [superpowers testing](/world/bauhinia/superpowers/)

### Foreign relations

Bauhinia is in a cold war against [Moreland](/world/moreland/). They have also finlandized and attempted to annex [Fanton](/world/fanton/), an attempt which failed but made Fanton take their side in the cold war. They engage in exploitive activities in [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/) not unlike that of Moreland's.

### Eternal death

Bauhinia has a weird and unusual punishment for people that *really* pissed the government off — eternal death. That is when their souls are taken out and stored in a vacuum jar. A normal death sentence, either shooting or injection, allows the dead to reincarnate on the Bridge. But if your soul did not die, you cannot reincarnate!

[Entity](/characters/entity/) is an executioner of this.

## Economy

Bauhinia is controlled by a huge company called [Starcorp](starcorp/) that nearly monopolizes every industry in the country.

The wealth gap is really damn big.

Bauhinia is a major importer of agricultural produce from places like [Fanton](/world/fanton/) and [Westavia](/world/westavia/), and an exporter of processed products.

I don't really understand economics enough.

## Society

Everyone is batshit crazy in Bauhinia.

Bauhinia emphasizes love, empathy, harmony, and family. Too bad it's actually full of hate, apathy, discord, and [single dads raising 4 kids each with different bio parents](/characters/peacock/). (The [oldest one](/characters/fantasy/) is an adult now though so she doesn't count.)

### Naming conventions

The name of a Bauhinian (or [Fantoni](/world/fanton/)) consists of three parts: the given name, and the parents' given names.

For girls, their names would be given name + mother's given name + father's given name. For example, "[Sparky](/characters/sparky/) [Amber](/characters/amber/) [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)."

For boys, their names would be given name + father's given name + mother's given name. For example, "[Bramble](/characters/bramble/) [Nightsun](/characters/nightsun/) [Sparky](/characters/sparky/)."

When your legal guardians change, they can apply for a name change for you. Sparky's name was Sparky Amber Jackal before Peacock became her stepdad. [Fantasy](/characters/fantasy/) also had her name changed from Fantasy Rainbow Peacock to Fantasy Amber Peacock. But [Ironheart](/characters/ironheart/) remained as Ironheart Peacock Reindeer because Amber had already died by the time he moved in with Peacock.

## History

Bauhinia used to be a huge empire spanning across almost the entire continent. That was why everyone spoke the same language, totally not because I'm too lazy.

The industrial revolution started in 1911, and the new technology gave the empire's peripheral too much power and they started dreaming of independence. The region that is modern-day Moreland launched a rebellion against the emperor. They were quickly crushed into submission by the imperial forces, who instead of killing the leaders to make an example, negotiated with them and came to an agreement that the Republic of Moreland is allowed to exist if they continue to honor the Bauhinian Emperor.

However, some partisans within Moreland refused to accept this, and launched an illegal coup that took over the government in an event known as the Guardian Moose Takeover. The Guardian Moose ruled the newly-controlled country in a dictatorship and took an anti-Bauhinian stance in every way.

(Meanwhile, Fanton declared independence, but like who are they anyways?)

The empire resumed their war with Moreland, but trouble was brewing back home. The Bauhinian people, tired of their outdated monarchy, also longed for a new form of government. The glorious republic revolution started in 1939 and in 1944, a republican government was established in Bauhinia. The new government recognized the necessity of a more multi-polar world and recognized the independence of Moreland, but not Fanton. The remaining imperial forces were wiped out in 1948 and the Empire had officially come to an end.

In Moreland, a group of dissidents of the regime went off and started their own country, Atlasia, and maintained independence from Moreland with Bauhinia's aid. At the same time, Westavia also declared independence as a satellite of Moreland's, and Bauhinia staged a border dispute which started a war between the two that ended when Bauhinia developed nuclear bombs and nuked Area 3, the industrial center of Westavia. To this day, Area 3 hasn't regained its industrial capabilities.

At the end of the war, the world formed a bipolar[^1] structure with Bauhinia and Moreland being in a state of cold war. Bauhinia recognized Fanton, Westavia, and Sylvandia.

In 2041, Bauhinia launched a reunification campaign to take back Fanton. The campaign failed due to Moreland's backdoor support for Fanton, but successfully made Fanton finlandized to Bauhinia.
