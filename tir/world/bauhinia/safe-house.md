Located in an old apartment complex the village-in-a-city of [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/), it used to be a drug-storage for [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/).

During the events of [New Year 2032](/stories/new-year-2032/), [Peacock](/characters/peacock/) gave [Sparky](/characters/sparky/) the keys to the apartment to temporarily hide from his parents. But there was a pick-up scheduled where the people going to pick it up didn't receive the message that the pick-up was cancelled. They ended up in a fight with Sparky [and](/characters/qibli/) [her](/characters/sky/) [friends](/characters/firecrackers/). After that, the safe house was abandoned by Starcorp. But Sparky made a copy of the key. Later, she used the apartment to hide [Pearl](/characters/pearl/) from Starcorp.
