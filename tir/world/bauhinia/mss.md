Their boots — lemme ramble about the boots! They could be as quiet as you want, to sneak up on people; but they could also be as loud as you want — dreadful, intimidating crunching sounds. The prints they leave behind aren't easily identifiable, and could easily be disguised into footprints of other animals. They are also designed to kill — a kick to crush the liver.

… Am I a bootlicker now?

That being said, most MSS agents operate in plain clothes, similar to how normal police wear uniforms and plainclothes don't.

## Rankings

- Noob: no white spots on shoulder pad, ranking only given to trainees.
- Half-Noob: trainees who completed their initial training will all be given this rank.
- Normal Rank: just a normal, average rank.
- Old Grouch: given to senior officers, either because they want them to feel content and shut up ([Paperweight](/characters/paperweight/)) or they had made significant contributions ([Goose](/characters/goose/), [Sky](/characters/sky/)).
