Their boots — lemme ramble about the boots! They could be as quiet as you want, to sneak up on people; but they could also be as loud as you want — dreadful, intimidating crunching sounds. The prints they leave behind aren't easily identifiable, and could easily be disguised into footprints of other animals. They are also designed to kill — a kick to crush the liver.

That being said, most MSS agents operate in plain clothes, similar to how normal police wear uniforms and plainclothes don't.
