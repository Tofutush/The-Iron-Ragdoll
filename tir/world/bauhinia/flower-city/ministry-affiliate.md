A school for ~~indoctrinating~~ training [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/) officers from a young age. The official shortening is "Ministry Affiliate" （国安附中）, but students usually call it spy school for short.

It starts in middle school (grade 7), and goes on to high school (grade 12). Though they share the same Flower City campus, middle schoolers go home every day while high schoolers stay in dormitories and only go home once a week.

The school functions like any other public middle / high school in Bauhinia, except that middle schoolers don't have to take the high school entrance exam if they don't want to. Say if you don't want to attend high school here anymore, or if you flunked out of the final exam (which ends before high school entrance starts, thankfully) here, then you could take that exam and go somewhere else.

The subjects taught are wildly different too.

## History

Ministry Affiliate is established quite late, in 2010. It was when the MSS found it too much of a hassle to train competent adults in the ways of the ministry when training kids and turning them into competent adults could happen at the same time.

Despite this, the military remains the ministry's largest source of recruits.
