A school for ~~indoctrinating~~ training [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/) officers from a young age. The official shortening is "Ministry Affiliate" （国安附中）, but students usually call it spy school for short.

It starts in middle school (grade 7), and goes on to high school (grade 12). Though they share the same Flower City campus, middle schoolers go home every day while high schoolers stay in dormitories and only go home once a week.
