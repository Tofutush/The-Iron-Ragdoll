A school for [magicians](/world/superpowers/#magic), ran by the Bauhinian government, established in 2017 by the Arch-Magician [Nebula](/characters/nebula/). Every magician in Bauhinia with a level above or equal to 10 and is older than 10 years is required to attend (the "double ten" policy).

Students can "graduate" from the school after going there every day for 5 years and passing the graduation exam; and after that, an exam is administered every 5 years. Failing those would get you back into the school.

The Arch-Magician is always the principal and only teacher in the school. And the Arch-Magician always come from Bauhinia due to [historical reasons](/world/bauhinia/superpower/#magic). Class size usually doesn't exceed 50 people.

## Attending

The school's location is secret. A school bus goes around picking students up and dropping them down in the basement, where they enter a door into the classroom. When they're finished, the bus sends them back. The bus can also warp itself around the country, so you could attend school no matter where you are. There is no driver, but there is police present keeping order.

Time does not pass once you get on the bus, which means that you could get on, go to school, and by the time you get home, barely any time would have passed.

These are the charms the Arch-Magician cast on the school bus and grounds so that no one would be unable to attend due to distance or schedule.

Students are required to put their wands inside a box in the classroom, and are not allowed to take them out unless the teacher explicitly told them to, which is usually during the practice period.

## Layout

(I'm really bad at organizing sections, LOL.)

There are two rooms, a classroom and a practice room, with a hallway in between. There is a janitor's closet in the hallway. The basement door leads to the classroom. There is a locked door in the practice room with the smell of outside under the gap between the door and the floor[^1].

## Teachings

The ultimate purpose of the magic academy is to limit magicians' power and to train them into useful tools of the government.

## Secrets

- Inside the janitor's closet there is an ancient book. It's just a normal magic guide during its time, but presently, most of the spells contained inside are illegal, and the book is essentially a guide on dark magic. [Qibli](/characters/qibli/) found this with [Trinket](/characters/trinket/), and their split attitudes towards the book broke their friendship.
- The school is actually located in [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/). No one thought that anyone could actually find it, though.
