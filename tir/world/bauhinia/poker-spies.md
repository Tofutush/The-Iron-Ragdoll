During the Fantoni War, [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/) officer [Sky](/characters/sky/) ran a ring of four spies gathering intel and doing deception. Sky liked representing them with the ace cards of the four suits, which is why they are later referred to as the "Poker Spies." Read more about their stories [here](/stories/the-poker-spies/).

## The spies

- [Tsunami](/characters/tsunami/): Ace of Diamonds; blue chip
- [Jumbo](/characters/jumbo/): Ace of Hearts; red chip
- [Mulberry](/characters/mulberry/): Ace of Spades; green chip
- [Blackjack](/characters/blackjack/): Ace of Clubs; black chip

## Trivia

The inspiration behind this is [Operation Fortitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortitude)[^1] and the wider [Double-Cross System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Cross_System). Ben Macintyre wrote a good book about it called *Double Cross*.
