During the Fantoni War, [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/) officer [Sky](/characters/sky/) ran a ring of four spies gathering intel on [Fanton](/world/fanton/) and [Moreland](/world/moreland/). Sky liked representing them with the ace cards of the four suits, which is why they are later referred to as the "Poker Spies."

## History

So yeah Sky recruited them and they did stuff lol idk yet

After the war ended, Sky was awarded with eternal bragging rights and a choice to work wherever he wanted to. He decided to become a teacher at [Ministry Affiliate](/world/bauhinia/ministry-affiliate/)[^1].

Later, two [stupid](/characters/harmony/) [kids](/characters/sugarcane/) heard about the spy ring and decided to [invite them all over for a party](/stories/poker-party/).

## Trivia

The inspiration behind it would be either the [Normandy deception campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Cross_System)[^2] or the [Cambridge Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five), depending on what role I decide to give the pokers.
