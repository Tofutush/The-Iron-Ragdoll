Association of superpowered people, or "the gifted" as they're known in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/). Headquarters in [People's Vanguard](/world/westavia/peoples-vanguard/), [Westavia](/world/westavia/).

The ISA is in charge of regulating the use of powers (though it's still up to the governments to implement that regulation), and awarding people with the Arch title.

In its main meeting room in People's Vanguard, there is a Westavian 7-point star on the floor, with a seat at each point for the seven Arch-people.
