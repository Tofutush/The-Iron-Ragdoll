Association of superpowered people, or "the gifted" as they're known in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/). Its main task is to promote equality between normal and superpowered people and ensure proper regulations around superpower usage.

Any inter-governmental organization on the continent is in a fragile middle-ground as it's near impossible to not be involved in the cold war. Usually, inter-governmental organizations end up completely serving one side, or completely useless like the [IC](/world/ic/). However, the ISA has a very intricate balance between the two sides. It's housed in Westavia, but one of the most important positions, the Arch-Magician, is always Bauhinian. In addition, there's also the belief that superpowers transcend nationalities, and Council members are generally not viewed as a citizen of any country. State-interference in the protege they chose to succeed them (usually pressuring them to choose someone from their own country) is greatly frowned upon, though governments would occasionally try.

## Headquarters

ISAHQ is located in [People's Vanguard](/world/westavia/peoples-vanguard/), [Westavia](/world/westavia/).

In its main meeting room, there is a Westavian 7-point star on the floor, with a seat at each point for the seven Council members.

## Council

For each superpower, be it common or special, there will be at most *one* person alive at a time who will represent the power at the Council, bearing the title of Arch-whatever-they-are.

Arch-people, more often referred to as "members of the [ISA](/world/isa/) Council," are obviously the most powerful at whatever their superpower is. How this is determined, though, is another matter. If the previous Council member had some protege they named, usually their wishes are abided by. But if not, there would be a lot of backs-and-forth between the ISA and other governments. To interfere with this decision out of political incentives is greatly frowned-upon, which is why you don't let people know you have political incentives.

## Responsibilities

The ISA is in charge of regulating the use of powers, and awarding people with the Arch title.

Countries adhere to the *Agreement on the Regulation Surrounding Superpower Usage* by signing that and becoming a member of the ISA. [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) is the only country who didn't, and therefore no Atlasian had the chance to be admitted to the Council, and it's difficult to study the current superpower scene in the country.
