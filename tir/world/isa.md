Association of superpowered people, or "the gifted" as they're known in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/). Its main task is to promote equality between normal and superpowered people and ensure proper regulations around superpower usage.

## Headquarters

ISAHQ is located in [People's Vanguard](/world/westavia/peoples-vanguard/), [Westavia](/world/westavia/).

In its main meeting room, there is a Westavian 7-point star on the floor, with a seat at each point for the seven Arch-people.

## Responsibilities

The ISA is in charge of regulating the use of powers, and awarding people with the Arch title.

Countries adhere to the *Agreement on the Regulation Surrounding Superpower Usage* by signing that and becoming a member of the ISA. [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) is the only country who didn't, and therefore no Atlasian had the chance to be crowned an Arch, and it's difficult to study the current superpower scene in the country.
