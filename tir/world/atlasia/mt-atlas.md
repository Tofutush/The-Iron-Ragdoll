The tallest mountain on the continent, in [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/), near the border with [Moreland](/world/moreland/).

Mt. Atlas is a part of a mountain range, collectively called the Atlasian Mountains, that goes along the western border of Atlasia and blocks the wind going into [Westavia](/world/westavia/), making the country really dry.
