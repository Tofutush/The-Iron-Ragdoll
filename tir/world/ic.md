The IC is like the UN in TIR, established in 1945, shortly after the nuking of Westavia and before the new cold-war world order was established, and one of the very first things they managed to do was get every country to recognize each other and sign an agreement to stop the production of any more nuclear weapons (not that it stopped them). Its headquarters is located in [the Capital](/world/atlasia/the-capital/), [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/).

It became completely useless shortly after as every single vote results in a 3-3 tie so it never gets anything done, as exemplified by their failure to stop the Fantoni invasion war. And also people hate working in fucking Atlasia.

The [ISA](/world/isa/) gets way more stuff done and is generally more like the actual inter-governmental organization which has actually made accomplishments in advancing human rights.
