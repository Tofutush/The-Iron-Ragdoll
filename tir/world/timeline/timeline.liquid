<p>This is a cheesy port of my Aeon Timeline project! Because of this, I can't add any links, and events with both a start and end are displayed rather awkwardly. But at last, everything I have on TIR is on the website. I am hiding nothing from you! (I'd be such a terrible spy LMAO)</p>
<div class="attr">
  {% for item in timeline %}
    <p>{{ item.time }}</p>
    <p>{{ item.label }}</p>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
