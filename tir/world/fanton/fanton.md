## Geography

Fanton borders [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) on the southeast, [Westavia](/world/westavia/) on the north, and shares a short border with [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) on the northeast.

Fanton's territory covers the [Fantoni Plateau](/world/fanton/fantoni-plateau/) and the [Fantoni Basin](/world/fanton/fantoni-basin/).

Its capital, [Lotus Lake City](/world/fanton/lotus-lake-city/), rests on a plain at the edge of the basin.

The closest geographical mirror to Bauhinia is Sichuan plus the Yungui Plateau plus the Tibetan Plateau[^1].

[^1]: It used to be *just* Sichuan. Why do I keep making Fanton bigger and bigger?

## Government

Fanton is a republic. The government of Fanton highly values environmental preservation, which is one of its founding ideals, baked into the constitution.

Many things are banned in Fanton, including but not limited to drugs, alcohol, tobacco and nicotine, swearing in public, and addictive stuff like gambling, gacha games, and short video apps. The police train dogs to not only detect drugs, but also drinks and smokes.

## Economy

Fanton remains relatively unindustrialized and heavily relies on the exportation of crops and materials and the importation of products. However, due to the broad category of banned stuff, there is a flourishing underground black market rife with smuggling bootlegged stuff like drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and [souls](/world/souls/).

## Society

Most Fantoni are brought up as nature-loving and vegetarian. In fact, most restaurants and cafeterias only serve vegetarian food. Because of this, the Fantoni have developed millions of different ways to make tofu, much to the delight of [Sparky](/characters/sparky/).

### Naming conventions

Fanton has the same naming conventions as [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/). [See here](/world/bauhinia/#naming-conventions).

## History

Fanton was originally a part of the Bauhinian Empire. During the empire's industrialization, a group of people got mad at the destruction of nature and the endangerment of many plant and animal species. They saw their chance when revolution broke out in Bauhinia. Following all the other countries, they declared independence.

Fanton was created at such a convenient time when everyone else was too busy sorting out their own mess to give a snabbergatt about Fanton. The republic survived.

The creation of Fanton led a lot of the original inhabitants to move out in frustration, and a lot of like-minded individuals in other places to move in.
