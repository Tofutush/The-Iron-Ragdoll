The capital of the Sylvandian Federation. A special district that does not belong to any state, it borders [Holliloli](/world/sylvandia/holliloli/) on the west and [Snowdale](/world/sylvandia/snowdale/) on the east, and is pretty close to the [Moreland](/world/moreland/) border.

## Trivia

- The name is based off of Bonn, capital of West Germany.
	- It's meant to invoke the feeling of a small town being elevated to capital status overnight, vaguely inspired by *A Small Town in Germany* by John le Carré.
