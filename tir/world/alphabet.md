The Bauhinian Empire had a universal language and alphabet. Even long after the empire split apart, everyone still spoke the same language and wrote the same script.

## What language did the continent speak?

I would say they speak their own language, different from all of ours.

Truth is, it doesn't really matter, as long as everyone is speaking the same language. When I write about them, they speak in whatever language I'm writing in, which can only be Chinese and English. If other people write about them in another language, they'd be speaking that language. Whatever language they're speaking, the puns specific to that language would always make sense.

People in TIR are named after concepts (for the most part; exceptions will always be present). For example, Willow is named after the tree, and Amber is named after the gemstone. In another language, their names would simply be whatever the willow tree and amber stone is called in that language[^1].

I made this writing system in a maniacal spree in one night. It is inspired by the Uyghur alphabet, which is in turn based off of the Arabic abjad[^2]. Therefore, the Bauhinian alphabet has the features of being written from right to left, top to bottom; letters are joined together in a word, and each letter has a different way of being written, depending on their position in a word — beginning, middle, or end. It is more of a cipher, actually; designed to be directly transcribed from Uyghur to Bauhinian.

The next day, I organized the script a little more and made it transcribable from Chinese and English as well.

## The letters

The script features five base shapes, which I call: tall loops, short loops, R's, bumps, and breaks.

<figure><img class="max" src="/img/bg/alphabet/br.png" alt="Break"/><figcaption>Break</figcaption></figure>

The letters are then constructed by adding diacritics to these base shapes. Diacritics include a dot, a line (horizontal, vertical, or slanted), or an arrow (four directions).

Following are four tables for transcription from Uyghurche, Chinese, and English to Bauhinian, and one to transcribe from Bauhinian.

## Uyghurche

| Uyghurche | ULY | Bauhinian                               |
| --------- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| ئا        | a   | <img src="/img/bg/alphabet/tl-sr.png"/> |
| ئە        | e   | <img src="/img/bg/alphabet/tl-sl.png"/> |

## Chinese

## English

## Bauhinian order

As you can notice, not all base shape and diacritic combinations are used, creating possibilities for more sounds not present in these three languages.

[^1]: One time, when I was trying to name [Natasha](/characters/natasha/), I was like "I usually name my characters after things but I really like the name Natasha," and then a person suggested to me I name her after a thing but as the Russian word. Which wouldn't make sense, because concepts don't have languages. I ended up going for Natasha anyways, as you can see.
[^2]: An alphabet is a writing system where each sound, vowel and consonant, is represented by a symbol. An abjad only contains consonants and leaves the vowels up to reader's inference. Though the two are largely similar, Arabic uses an abjad while Uyghur uses an alphabet.
