They are all open species — see more [here](/about/#fan-content).

## Winghorses

It's like a horse, but it's got wings!

## Tadlets

When it's little, it looks like a tadpole with wings, a horn, and a little bit of fur on its tail.

When it grows up, it will turn into some sort of animal, but it's impossible to tell from a tadlet what it's going to turn into unless you do a DNA test. The fun in keeping tadlets lies in finding out what animal it is. It's like a living gacha!

The age range of a tadlet is typically 5 months, regardless of the kind of creature they turn into (they're still in essence the same species). A tadlet egg takes about 2 weeks to hatch into a tadlet, and at 2 months they start their metamorphosis. After a week, their metamorphosis is complete, and they start reproducing. On average, a tadlet can lay about 500 eggs in its lifetime, though only a fraction of them would hatch, and a fraction of *that* would live to metamorphosis[^1].

In [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), all kids are required to keep a tadlet as a part of their third grade curriculum.
