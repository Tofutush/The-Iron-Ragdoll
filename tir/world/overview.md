A brief overview of the world to get you a most basic idea of what this paracosm entails!

## The world

So, there is a continent that as far as we're concerned is the entire world unless one day I just snap and create another continent out there.

On the continent there are six countries: [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), in the south; [Fanton](/world/fanton/), north of Bauhinia; [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/), north of Fanton and east of Westavia; [Westavia](/world/westavia/), north of Fanton and west of Atlasia; [Moreland](/world/moreland/), north of Atlasia and Westavia; and [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/), north of Moreland.

To the east is a vast ocean where nobody can sail far. To the west is barren wastelands uninhabitable by man.

So basically:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/world/sylvandia/">Sylvandia</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/world/moreland/">Moreland</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/world/westavia/">Westavia</a> / <a href="/world/atlasia/">Atlasia</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/world/fanton/">Fanton</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a></p>

All of them are republics, but Sylvandia's a federation while others are all unitary.

Yes I mapped the continent to eastern Asia because I'm terrible at geography. It's basically China, Mongolia, and Siberia.

They're locked in an perpetual cold war between [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) and [Moreland](/world/moreland/), splitting the continent into the north and the south, with [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) being with [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), and [Westavia](/world/westavia/) with [Moreland](/world/moreland/), who also has great influence over [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/). [Fanton](/world/fanton/) is unaligned though slightly finlandized by Bauhinia. During the course of the story, Bauhinia would launch an invasion of Fanton and while failing to annex them, would make Fanton officially on Bauhinia's side.

So basically:

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a> + <a href="/world/atlasia/">Atlasia</a> + (<a href="/world/fanton/">Fanton</a>) VS <a href="/world/moreland/">Moreland</a> + <a href="/world/westavia/">Westavia</a> + (<a href="/world/sylvandia/">Sylvandia</a>)</p>

## Bauhinia

The main focus here is [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), a bureaucratical fanatical corporate dictatorship[^1].

There's a company called [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), the most powerful company in Bauhinia (and undoubtedly the whole world), having gotten rich during the war through arms dealing, declined for a bit, but rose again thanks to the legendary chairman [Hyrax](/characters/hyrax/). Starcorp now controls most of Bauhinia's industries and resources.

## Major storylines

I love it when many characters' lives intertwine and everyone is the protagonist of their own story but side characters in someone else's story, so that's basically TIR's structure too. There's no clear protagonist aside from Sparky, and no clear *main* storyline. That being said, here are some of the major storylines you can follow!

- [Sparky](/characters/sparky/), the center of our universe. She solves mysteries and gets in trouble with her friends. Also her stepdad [Peacock](/characters/peacock/) is the personal attorney of chairman [Hyrax](/characters/hyrax/). Later, after Sparky grew up, [Hyrax](/characters/hyrax/) had his son [Animus](/characters/animus/) replace him as the chairman, and had Sparky become Animus's bodyguard. See her stories [here](/characters/sparky/#stories).
- [Kismet](/characters/kismet/), the ~~dictator~~ president of Bauhinia, [has his own arc and all](/stories/tag/kismets-presidency/).
- [Candlelight](/characters/candlelight/), a pile of misery, [goes through a lot of shit](/characters/candlelight/#stories).
- [Sunflower](/characters/sunflower/), a girl who paracosms, [dies](/characters/sunflower/#stories).
- [Qibli](/characters/qibli/), one of Sparky's friends, [becomes an outlaw and stuff](/characters/qibli/#stories).
- [Sky](/characters/sky/), one of Sparky's friends, [becomes a spymaster and stuff](/stories/poker-spies/) and then goes to teach at Spy School.
- [Harmony](/characters/harmony/) and [Sugarcane](/characters/sugarcane/)'s friendship gets tested as [they go to said spy school](/stories/tag/spy-school/).
- In Fanton, a [group of friends tries to find their missing friend](/stories/one-man-short/).

Of course there are many more characters and their arcs, but that's about it for the overview. Read about the ~~plot devices~~ [superpowers](/world/superpowers/) some people in this world have. Or read about the [history](/world/history/) of the countries!

[^1]: How do these four words even go together?
