A small region in the countryside of Westavia. On its outskirts lies a [nameless village](/world/westavia/nameless-village/).

Its historical name was "Yigirme Toqquzinchi (يىگىرمە توققۇزىنچى)[^1]."

[^1]: OKAY OKAY hear me out — I really don't have any brain power left to come up with fancy names for them, since I'd be referring to them as English "Area \[number]" anyways and fancy names can be better used for other countries' cities. Can we please just pretend that this name holds great importance in Westavian culture? Pretty please? If you don't get it, then great. If you do get it, then Area 1 was Birinchi, Area 2 was Ikkinchi, and so on. People's Vanguard was Nölinchi, which is stupid but hehehe.
