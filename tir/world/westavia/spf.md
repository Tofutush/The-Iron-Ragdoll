A branch of Westavia's police force, the SPF is Westavia's internal security apparatus aimed at surveilling its citizens and suppressing dissent.

Despite their name, they don't actually prevent suicides. Instead, they mark possible "troublemakers" down as suicide-prone, and use that to justify 24/7 surveillance and limiting their activities, like riding trains or planes or something.

Ever since its creation, the SPF has seen a gradual younger ageing of their targets. Now, most of their suicide watch targets are middle and high schoolers. This is not only so that I can tell stories about cops beating teenagers up, but more importantly it shows the *success* of the SPF in keeping Westavia's citizens in line.
