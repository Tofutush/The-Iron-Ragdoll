- Removed all the extra unused metadata on images, like "scope" and "style." Got rid of like 500 lines.
- Gave footer images a drop shadow in dark mode.
- Moved the input directory to a subfolder since things are getting cloggy.

## 2025-02-25

	- Changed the style a bit, most notably the sticky header.
	- Applied the layout to the [404 page](/the-five-boxing-wizards-jump-quickly/).
	- Did some things about the site templating that don't affect *you*, but makes *my* life better.
	- Hopefully, I won't be spending this much time on the site itself later on, and focus on the content instead. "Tofutush likes coding more than paracosming" didn't come out of nowhere, but it shall go into nowhere.

## 2025-01-21
