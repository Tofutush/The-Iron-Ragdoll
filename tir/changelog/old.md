- Added logic for auto-picking relationship images;
	- Other people's art credits are shoved inside the title text; you need to hover over the image to see that. Sorry but I can't really find a prettier way to show that; tried figures but I can't get the sizing right. You can still see their linked credits in the gallery section;

- Changed the separator style;
	- This is so minor I don't usually log it but the site's having a big lack of updates because of the PMV project LOL;

If you drew art for me before and would like that featured, just tell me that!

- Gave footer images a drop shadow in dark mode.
