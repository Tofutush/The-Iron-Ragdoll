## 2025-12-02

- Fixed a problem where "previous" story links with parenthesis in their titles (notably Sunflowers in the Dark (working title)) led to 404;
	- I completely brought this upon myself I need to come up with fancy titles for them;
- Okay I did it. [Sunflowers in the Dark](/stories/sunflowers-in-the-dark/) is promoted to proper title status, Sunflower 2 is renamed [Tadlet Kingdom Adventures](/stories/tadlet-kingdom-adventures/), and the Hunt for Tundra is renamed [Operation Ice Age](/stories/operation-ice-age/);
	- Please do [report](https://tofutush.leprd.space/guestbook/) any resulting 404 errors (except those in changelogs which are meant to be preserved), as the URLs have changed;

- Added a "complete" field to stories;

## 2025-11-25

## 2025-11-24
