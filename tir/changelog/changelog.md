- Moved June to [older updates](old/);

## 2025-07-31

- Changed the layout of the [World](/world/) section a bit;
	- Now there would be no more nested city folders — every file in a country lies flat in that folder;
	- This might lead to some broken links. I'll try to catch them, but if you notice one then feel free to [tell me](/contact/)!
- Also made [world file categories](/world/category/);

## 2025-07-30

- Important days will now show up on the front page!

## 2025-07-26

- Made the color palette look cooler! It's now diagonal;
	- I also solved the jarring expansion problem. Turns out I just needed an `overflow: hidden`. Long palettes expand smoothly now! See [Buttercup](/characters/buttercup/);
