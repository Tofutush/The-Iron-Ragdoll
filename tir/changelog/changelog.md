## 2025-07-12

- Added `ri.png`, `esther.png`;

## 2025-07-11

- Added all art received from Artfight thus far;
- Added `jon.gif`;
- Published [Harmony Spies](/stories/oneshots/chapter-3/);

## 2025-07-10

- Set up a scheduled build every midnight UTC;
	- Now birthday messages can appear automatically;
	- Expect more stuff like holiday messages and perhaps even seasonal themes to come!

## 2025-07-03

- Stopped putting other's art at the back of character galleries;
	- Now they're sorted by character count only;
- Moved May to older updates;
- I did all of this on mobile LOL; let's hope nothing goes wrong;

## 2025-06-29

- Added `mynx.png`, `firecrackers sign comic.png`;

## 2025-06-28

- Published the [Goose PMV](https://youtu.be/v4ats5O0mio)!
- Added a [Robot Master](https://kunfucutsman.neocities.org/fun/robot-master-maker/) on the [about](/about/) file;
- Changed the page background. We'll see how it goes;
- Froze the gifs in the gallery thumbnails;
- Added a link to the drawing perms on character pages;
	- Mainly so you can skip the gallery to the bottom for whatever reason;
- Added `goose pumpkin strawberiishortcake.png`, `pmv cover.png`, `pmv cover en.png`;

## 2025-06-26

- Started to use SmartGB [guestbook](/contact/);
- Added `woshilunhui.png`;
- Added logic for auto-picking relationship images;
	- Other people's art credits are shoved inside the title text; you need to hover over the image to see that. Sorry but I can't really find a prettier way to show that; tried figures but I can't get the sizing right. You can still see their linked credits in the gallery section;

## 2025-06-23

- Added `goose purge.png`;
- Deleted the character age page in favor of a birthday column in the [sortable list](/characters/list/);
	- I still liked the card view though, dunno where else I can use that for;
- Added a thing where the main page shows what characters have their birthday today! Let's see if it actually works though;
	- Main thing is that it only checks dates on each build, which means the date won't update unless a build is triggered. Fortunately I might be able to just run the job on Github even with no updates;

## 2025-06-22

- Changed the separator style;
	- This is so minor I don't usually log it but the site's having a big lack of updates because of the PMV project LOL;
- Also, I'm gathering fanart to feature at the end of the PMV! Draw anybody (though the protagonist of the PMV is [Goose](/characters/goose/)) and [send it to me](/contact/) (any other messaging platform works too, if you know where I am), along with how you wish to be credited. If you drew art for me before and would like that featured, just tell me that!

## 2025-06-19

- Added a bunch of character birthdays! You can find them on their respective profiles, or the [Calendar](/world/calendar/);
	- Also retconned [Nightsun](/characters/nightsun/)'s birthday for no reason;
- Added a [characters sorted by age](/characters/age/) page;
- Changed the heading font because yes;
	- I considered asking other people for feedback, but no;

## 2025-06-16

- Added word counts to stories in the lists;
- Edited the countries' history sections to be biased;
- Added new random pages! Check them out in the [Fun](/fun/) page;
- Added "page source" and "archive this page" links to the footer;

## 2025-06-15

- Added `sky cards.png`, `sky sans cards.png`;
- Added [Poker Spies](/world/bauhinia/poker-spies/);
- Edited the history sections of the countries a little;
- Retconned a bit of [world history](/world/history/) surrounding the Guardian Moose Takeover;
- Made the story tags sort alphabetically;

## 2025-06-13

- Apologies for not enough art; I'm working on an animation project!
	- It's not really animation LOL, just low-quality pictures moving around in After Effects. It's about [Goose](/characters/goose/) (and the [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/) in general);
- Added oneshot [The Occupation](/stories/the-occupation/);

## 2025-06-12

- After a painful failed attempt to move this site from Liquid to Vento, I opted to merely change the "Table of Contents" text to just "Contents" since it used to be inconsistent;

## 2025-06-03

- Added `nebula thumb.png`, `candlelight meets curly.png`, `snake wings.png`;

## 2025-06-02

- Added `pearl footer.png`, `sugarcane harmony footer.png`;
	- They have also been added to the site footers;

## 2025-06-01

- Added `nebula lilypad.png`, `nebula cross legs.png`, the latter of which is her pagedoll now;
- Made the character trivia section more flexible for myself;
