## 2025-03-04

- Updated the [overview](/world/overview/).
- Added a [projects page](/projects/).

## 2025-03-03

- Edited the two Candlelight stories.
- Put some character progress stats in the [text list](/characters/list/).
- Removed an embarrassing mistake in the theme switch JS.
- Added `trinket thumb.png`, and updated the horned characters' thumbs to the new design where their horn colors are just their soul color.

## 2025-03-02

- Moved January updates to [old](/changelog/old/) because I forgot to yesterday.

## 2025-03-01

- Added a CC BY-NC-SA license.

## 2025-02-28

- Added stories [Project Boomerang](/stories/project-boomerang/) and [The Hunt for Tundra](/stories/the-hunt-for-tundra/).
- Fixed The Hunt for Tundra displaying Tundra colors. It's just a working title anyways.
- Edited [Sunflowers in the Dark](/stories/sunflowers-in-the-dark/).

## 2025-02-27

- Added `signe luna.png` and `xavier.png`.

## 2025-02-26

- Released the Goose comic! Read it [here](/stories/goose-opens-the-door/page-1/)!
- Applied a layout to the gallery. You won't notice since literally nothing changed.
	- More gallery stats because I'm a stats nerd.
	- Also, made the years collapsible.
- Removed all the extra unused metadata on images, like "scope" and "style." Got rid of like 500 lines.
- Gave footer images a drop shadow in dark mode.
- Moved the input directory to a subfolder since things are getting cloggy.

## 2025-02-25

- Deleted the now-useless navigation page. RIP, your life was short and useless.
- Gained determination to write a better changelog.
- Turned some JSON metadata into YAML.
- Added a little tag icon in front of tag lists, which only exist [here](/characters/tag/) and on character page sidebars.
- Changed [Westavia](/world/westavia/)'s full name to The People's Republic of Westavia, and [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/)'s to The Free Republic of Atlasia.
	- Also a theme song title for Westavia.
- Revamped the [Kaleidoscope's fate](/stories/one-man-short/#kaleidoscopes-fate/) section of One Man Short so that my dear Kally isn't a horrible person anymore.
- Removed the RSS feed and all links to it.
- Changed the dark mode accent color to blue.

## 2025-02-24

- Moved [Bramble's Happy Family](/stories/brambles-happy-family/) to its own story page.

## 2025-02-23

- A huge update! I moved the dead-water pigeon comic off the front page and into the back instead. It can be found [behind Hillslope Mysteries](/stories/hillslope-mysteries/page-0/).
	- Changed the style a bit, most notably the sticky header.
	- Applied the layout to the [404 page](/the-five-boxing-wizards-jump-quickly/).
	- Did some things about the site templating that don't affect *you*, but makes *my* life better.
	- Hopefully, I won't be spending this much time on the site itself later on, and focus on the content instead. "Tofutush likes coding more than paracosming" didn't come out of nowhere, but it shall go into nowhere.

## 2025-02-21

## 2025-02-16

- Added a [Gallery stats](/gallery/stats/) page.
- Added [People's Vanguard](/world/westavia/peoples-vanguard/).
- Slight tweaks to the CSS.
	- I don't really know why I wrote that down; I mean if you can find the changes with your eyes (without looking in Github) you could probably qualify for some superhuman award.
