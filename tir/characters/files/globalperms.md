- **Design clarifications**
	- The marks on the girls' faces are eyelashes, not face paint! You can draw whatever you want; I'm just making sure you don't think it's face paint.
	- None of my characters have real-world skin colors! Their races are just whether they have ears or horns on their heads, so everyone's skin color is the same.
	- You can draw whatever color you want as long as it's either normal human color, or grayscale. My default is Asian though for your reference.
	- The highlights on their hair are parts of the design, and are optional
- **Go wild**
	- Basically anything not mentioned in **Don't**.
	- Gore (any type)
	- Interacting with each other (mine, yours, or anyone else's)
	- Change anything about them (outfit, gender, species, in-universe race (the ear / horn thing), whatever) (just make sure their eye color stays the same)
	- Mass attacks
	- Memes and shitposts
	- Go wild!
- **Don't**
	- NSFW, 18+, whatever
		- This involves artistic nudity
		- Or anything that sexualizes them
	- Change their eye color *too* much
	- Non-canon ships
	- Hateful stuff, duh
