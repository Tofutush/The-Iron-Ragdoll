- **Design clarifications**
	- The marks on the girls' faces are eyelashes, not face paint! You can draw whatever you want; I'm just making sure you don't think it's face paint.
	- None of my characters have real-world skin colors! Their races are just whether they have ears or horns on their heads, so everyone's skin color is the same.
		- You can draw whatever color you want as long as it's either normal human color, or grayscale. My default is Asian though for your reference.
	- The highlights on their hair are parts of the design, and are *optional*.
	- Their ears are *furry* but not *fluffy*. Shorthair, if you may.
- **Don't**
	- NSFW, 18+, whatever
		- This involves artistic nudity
		- Or anything that sexualizes them
	- Change their eye color *too* much
	- Non-canon ships
	- Hateful stuff, duh
- **Go wild**
	- Everything else should be fine, such as gore, interaction with anyone, outfit / in-universe race / gender / species swap, mass attacks, etc
	- If you're not sure, feel free to ask!
