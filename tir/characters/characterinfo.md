If a certain field is missing or not specific enough, then it is *open to interpretation*.

For example, if a character's sexuality is not given, then you can let it be anything you want.

And if the "gender" field only says "Male" or "Female" without specifying further, it means that the character *presents* as either male or female.

However, please do not stray away from information that *is* given!

The "Age estimation" is for characters without a specific birthday. "Around the same as" means that they're less than a year apart â€” if they went to school together they would be in the same grade. "A little younger/older" means they're probably 2 - 5 years apart.
