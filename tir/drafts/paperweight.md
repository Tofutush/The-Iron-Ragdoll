Paperweight is a senior officer at the [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/).

He usually maintains a very calm and authoritative composure to others, especially the people he deals with at work — spies, moles, and pesky annoying kids. But under his composure, he is a frothing pit of pure rage. He is constantly angry at everything at once but nothing in particular, saddled by the weight of his own guilt and his colleague's suspicion of treason. To people he knows, like [his](/characters/goose/) [subordinates](/characters/pumpkin/), he yells at them all the time. Also he's homophobic as fuck.

He misses the old times when he could actually run without his knees screaming murder and shoot a gun without his hands shaking. This is why he hates young people — because he's kind of jealous.

He wishes someone could believe him. He wanted [Whiteout](/characters/whiteout/) back.
