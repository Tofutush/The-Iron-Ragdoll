September the first happened to be a Monday. Harmony woke up early, even before her mom had left for work, and asked her to send a message to Sugarcane's mom saying that she was leaving. She triple-checked her school bag, and set off for Sugarcane's.

"Have fun at school!" Frosting said as she left. "Be safe!"

Harmony arrived just in time to see Sugarcane coming out from her apartment building.

"What a coincidence!" She said.

"Sure is," Sugarcane replied.

The guard was no longer present at the intersection. Instead, a barrier was set up on the lane, and a row of traffic police hurried around, directing the flood of cars that had taken over.

"Don't loiter!" Some of them yelled. "Drop off and go!"

Some of the students were pulling huge suitcases around. "How come?" Harmony asked.

"High-schoolers," Sugarcane replied. "They stay in the dorms."

"Don't cross the road here," an officer standing near the intersection put up an arm in front of them. "Turn right on this side and cross in front of the school entrance."

They did as she told them. At the entrance, they saw someone, presumably an upperclassman, holding up a big sign that said "*New students come here!*"
