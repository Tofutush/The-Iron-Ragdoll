HM: Why did Sugarcane get in the MSS but not me? I've been with her our whole lives! She can't be without me! I can't be without her!

SK: We have made our decision. It was made by the board. It's final.

HM: But why? I got an A+ too!

SK: Your grades aren't the only deciding factor.

HM: I don't understand.

SK: *Hands a gun to HM.* Take this. *Turns around the corner to see SC standing by the hallway in front of a door, apparently waiting for someone.* Shoot her.

HM: Wh-What?

SK: You heard me. Shoot her.

HM: *Hands trembling, looking in horror at SK.*

SK: *Sighs and takes the gun, walks to SC, hands it to her.* Hey Sugarcane?

SC: Um, what?

SK: *Points at HM down the hall.* Shoot her.

SC: *Immediately cocks the gun and pulls the trigger, firing a blank.*

SK: *This* is why.
