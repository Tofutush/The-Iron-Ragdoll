Candlelight went to Mooncake's after school as usual. She was becoming more and more like his sister.

Ever since Sundew ran, their dad Ember had become more volatile. Candlelight avoided him as much as possible, only going back home late at night to sleep. To his delight, Ember seemed to have found a job in Area 29, as he was often away from home for days at a time. Not today though, so Candlelight still opted for the old routine with Mooncake.

To their surprise, Mooncake's dad Thyme wasn't home.

"Where did your dad go?" Candlelight asked.

"No idea," Mooncake said. As soon as she finished, the village-wide emergency broadcast started ringing. Speakers perched atop poles started screaming with their raspy, long unused throat. Behind the static distortion, Thyme's deep, confident voice was unmistakable.

"Attention! This is your leader Thyme. There has been terrorist attack in Area 29. They have fled west. Please do not exit your homes unless necessary. I repeat, do not exit your homes until further notice."

"Another attack?" Candlelight said in disbelief. "They just never stop, do they?"

"What is there to attack about Area 29?" Mooncake said. "Birds don't even want to shit there."

They set down their backpacks and started playing their drawing games in their notebook. Mooncake had decided that Candlelight's garden had a pest invasion yesterday, and he was still trying to buy enough repellent for the three-by-three field of nine tiles. He could exchange for in-game currency with fancy rocks, and he had spent all the recesses today at school crouched on the ground, stuffing his pocket full of pebbles. He eagerly showed his collection to Mooncake.

"This one looks nice," she said. "That's about it. You got twenty bucks."

"But one repellent costs a hundred!"

"Go find more rocks then!"

"You're just picky," Candlelight said, but still got up to go outside. Just as he opened the door, Thyme was about to get back in.

Their house was near the edge of the village, and the communication center where Thyme gave the announcement was in the middle. The walk between them was about five minutes.

"What are you kids doing?" he said. "Didn't you hear what I said? Get back inside."

"But why?" Mooncake whined.

Thyme ushered them inside and closed the door. "The terrorists fled west after the attack. They had a way longer head start than the police. There's a chance they might come here."

"Really?" Mooncake asked.

Thyme walked to the window and looked outside, as if trying to spot out people running towards them. "It seems like they're going for the desert. If so, they might stop at a village on the way for food and water." He turned around to face the kids. "We're the only place between them and the desert."

Candlelight felt his heart pumping against his chest. He wiped a handful of sweat off his forehead and snuggled closer to Mooncake.

"You can stay here tonight if you want, Candle," Thyme said. "If you want to go home, I will walk you."

"Are we gonna fight them?" Mooncake held up her fists. "I can help!"

"No, we can't risk anything. We'll stay inside. They'll leave if they can't get anything out of us."

Thyme was right. Around eight in the evening, a group of people on horses galloped into the village. Seeing all these closed doors, the leader probably suspected that the villagers were expecting them.

They galloped through the small dirt roads, looking for a food storage or a well; but when they saw none, they decided to knock on someone's door.

Thyme answered. "You are not from here. Who are you and what do you want?"

His tone was one bit too hostile. The leader was now sure that they were expecting the terrorists, and the locked doors were their welcome.
