Candlelight went to Mooncake's after school as usual. She was becoming more and more like his sister.

Ever since Sundew ran away, their dad Ember had become more volatile. Candlelight avoided him as much as possible, only going back home late at night to sleep. To his delight, Ember seemed to have found a job in Area 29, as he was often away from home for days at a time. Not today though, so Candlelight still opted for the old routine with Mooncake.

Mooncake's dad Thyme wasn't home, and Mooncake assumed he must be in the communication center, doing village leader work. They set down their backpacks and started playing drawing games in their notebook. Mooncake had decided that Candlelight's garden had a pest invasion yesterday, and he was still trying to buy enough repellent for the three-by-three field of nine tiles. He could exchange for in-game currency with fancy rocks, and he had spent all the recesses today at school crouched on the ground, stuffing his pocket full of pebbles. He eagerly showed his collection to Mooncake.

"This one looks nice," she said. "That's about it. You got twenty bucks."

"But one repellent costs a hundred!"

"Go find more rocks then!"

"You're just picky," Candlelight said, but still got up to go outside. Just as he opened the door, Thyme was about to get back in.

"Bad news, kids," he said. "There's been an attack in Area 29."

"Another attack?" Candlelight said in disbelief. "They just never stop, do they?"

"What is there to attack about 29?" Mooncake said. "Birds don't even want to shit there."

"They have a huge head start against the police. The media hasn't been informed either; it only just happened. My cousin was the one who told me."

Thyme's cousin was working in Area 29. Mooncake held a hand to her mouth.

"Don't worry, she wasn't anywhere near the bazaar that got attacked. But she saw it. There was a bomb, apparently."

Candlelight and Mooncake just stared at each other. The attacks had become more frequent. They used to happen only in the more developed eastern side of the country, about where they could be blissfully oblivious, but Area 29 was in the very west, the city closest to their little village. It was almost as if the terrorists would be coming for *them* next.

"What do we do?" Mooncake asked.

"There is nothing we *can* do," Thyme said. "Let's just pray not a lot of people are hurt."

"How many terrorists were in the attack?" Candlelight asked.

"We don't know yet," Thyme answered. "We'll have to wait until the media does a report. It wouldn't be until at least tomorrow."

They didn't have to wait that long.

At around eight, four men on horses galloped into their little village. Candlelight and Mooncake ran out into the yard as they neared and marveled at these guests. They wore bandannas covering everything but their eyes, carried boxes and rucksacks that appeared to be empty, and looked extremely cool.

They stopped in front of them, asking, "Are your parents home?"

"Sure!" Mooncake nodded furiously. "I'll call my dad!"

She ran inside while Candlelight stayed out. "Who are you?" he asked.

"We're some tired travelers needing a night's rest." The man pulled his bandanna down so that his mouth showed, but didn't get off the horse. "We would be so grateful if you could provide us with food and water."

"We totally can!" Candlelight smiled. But then he remembered Thyme's words. "Do you know? There's an attack in 29. It hasn't been reported yet."

The man opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by Thyme's bellowing voice. "You are not welcome here!"

"Dad?" Mooncake tried to object but Thyme shoved her away with one hand, pulling Candlelight back with the other.
