Animus suddenly fell sick and was advised to not leave the house for a month, so Sparky has the entire month to herself.

She goofed around Coastline until she saw an ad of a reality show about bodyguards. They're looking for new contestants for a new season, and specifically for people new to the profession. This would be a chance to show off your talents and would help you get hired!

*Why don't I sign up?* Sparky can pretend to be new since she's not officially affiliated to Starcorp Security like Dragonfly is. Her job as a guard for Animus was very secret and never on paper. She gets paid from the family fund that pays everyone in Hyrax's and Peacock's families. No one would know. And then she can show them!

This is really appealing for Sparky's goddamn ego so she signed up as self-trained.
