Entity is an executioner.

Not really though. He's a soul-extractor.

He takes the souls of those sentenced to eternal death — not even allowed to reincarnate. He extracts them, locks them up in a jar, and sends the freshly-drained body to cremation. It's also the reason why he met Frosting, the archivist who handles the soul jars.

At work, he pulls up a stoic and serious face to hide his emotions. To his friends and family, though, he's a scaredy-cat. He screams at the tiniest of bugs and have to have Frosting deal with them. He jumps at the slightest sound.

He believes whole-heartedly that the government has a chip in his brain to monitor his thoughts.

People will tell you that bodies without souls are just corpses. I know it's false. They are very much alive. They can live on for around a week. And guess what? For the first few days, the soul — if it had not found a new body — can still feel the old body. I found out during my soul-extraction training, when my friend and I pulled each other's soul out in turn for fun. Which means, the condemned can feel their body being burned to ashes.

I try to live with the knowledge. That they will suffer the fire, that *I* enabled it, and that most of the time, their crimes aren't serious enough to warrant permanent death where even reincarnation, birthing as an *entirely new* soul, is not allowed. *Nothing* warrants that—

Stop thinking! *Stop thinking*, you stupid brain! Don't think — no, not the chip, don't think about it — Of course the government has their reasons! Some people *are* evil enough that there's no place in the world for them. Who am I to disagree? Right. Just do your job. Stop thinking about that. Think about your wife and daughter.

I take a deep breath, and I stop thinking.
