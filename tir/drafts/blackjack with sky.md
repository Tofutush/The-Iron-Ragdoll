## dialog

- win
	1. What do you plan to do if you're free? Defect? They won't have let you end up here if you're still worth anything to them. You truly don't belong anywhere.
	2. I used to sit on that side, where you were. My chips were heavier than yours. But I won, and my chips are still here with me.
- lose
	1. There's that saying. The house always wins. The Ministry always wins.
	2. You're lucky we're even giving you a chance at all.
	3. I don't even know who you are or what you did. And I'm not supposed to. I'm just dealing cards here.
- eat half dollar
	- The payout is 1.5 times your bet, so you should've received {amount}. I ate your half dollar. If this were C# I could've blamed the language, but this is GDScript and the dev intentionally called floor(). Think about this next time you want to bet an odd number.
- get to $900
	- You're almost there! I didn't expect you to make it this far.
