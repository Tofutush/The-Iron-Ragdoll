Harmony was curled up on the sofa with a book when there came a knock on the door. Entity went to get it.

A man in a jet-black uniform stood in the doorway, sporting two blue horns and a welcoming smile, hands held behind his back. Entity nearly slammed the door right back into his face, but he reached out a hand, stopped it, and put it behind again.

"Wh-What did I do?" Entity's voice was trembling as if the man was a spider he saw in a corner.

"Why, if there's anything you did, that was giving birth to a wonderful daughter! Is little Harmony home?"

His eyes locked with Harmony's for a split second. She sank back into the book, though her attention was still focused on him.

Entity turned around to face her. "Honey? It's for you."

"Actually," said the man, "is Mrs. Frosting home? I would love to discuss this matter with the whole family."

Entity nodded. "Darling!" he called.

Frosting came out from her study. "What is it?" And then she saw the man in the doorway. "Oh. What's the matter, officer?"

They sat down around the tea table. Harmony put her book face-down on the sofa. The man introduced himself as Sky, from the Ministry of State Security. Frosting made tea.

"I am here on behalf of the the Middle School for Young Officers in Training Affiliated to the Ministry of State Security." Sky began. "I know it's a mouthful. We usually call it Ministry Affiliate.

"Your daughter is about to graduate elementary school. We are giving her an offer to attend middle school here."

"Really?" Frosting burst out.

"You are not mistaken. Our administration saw potential in a student like Harmony."

For the second time, he looked into Harmony's eyes.

"Uh, what's Ministry Affiliate?" Harmony asked.

"It's a special school ran by the Ministry of State Security," Sky said. "Where you can start early in your training to become an officer there."

"Um." Harmony stared at him blankly. "Why do I want to go there?"

"Because we'll teach you things you'd never learn anywhere else." Sky took another sip of tea. "You get to participate in missions, catching spies that are damaging our national security. And finally you can graduate into becoming an officer just like me. It's gonna be… what do you call it? Super-duper cool!"

Harmony couldn't believe he just unironically said "super-duper." Maybe five years ago kids liked to say that. She did *not* want to be just like Sky.

"I was supposed to go to the same school as my friend," she said.

"Sugarcane? I just visited her yesterday. She agreed to attend."

Harmony caught her parents eyeing each other.

"…I can see why," Frosting said finally. "Sugarcane is a bright kid."

Harmony coughed.

"Of course, you're amazing too! That's why uncle Sky came to you too!" Frosting added immediately with no genuineness in her voice.

"I'm going wherever Sugarcane is going," Harmony said.

"Do we have time to consider?" Entity asked.

"Of course," Sky produced a booklet from his pocket. It was an introduction of the school. "When you're ready to attend, come to our office" — he pointed to an address written on the back cover — "with your ID and a document photo receipt. Make sure to take a new photo. The deadline is August 1st."

It was June 7th.

"Thank you, officer," Frosting said.

"I should be thanking *you*." Sky got up and headed for the door. "Bye! I look forward to teaching you." The cup of tea remained half-drunk.

"Well," Harmony said, "let's go get the photo taken!"

"Let's not rush things," Frosting said. "Take some time to consider it."

"What is there to consider?" Harmony picked the book back up from the sofa and headed for her room. "Sugarcane is going."

"Why don't you make sure first? Call Sugarcane and confirm it."

Harmony stopped in her track. That was a good point.
