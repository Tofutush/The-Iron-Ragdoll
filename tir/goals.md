A list of "stuff I wanna do" so I won't forget about them. I will never finish all of them — or even just some of them — in my entire life, and I know that perfectly well. It's called self-awareness.

## The Iron Ragdoll

Originally planned as a comic; is now a paracosm after I learnt the word. What this entire site is dedicated to. Though it would probably never reach a "finished" state, I do wanna refine everything I have at the moment.

## Havoc101

Originally planned as a kinda-open-world point and click game where you wreak havoc around the school. See its planning site [here](https://tofutush.github.io/havoc101).

Would probably never actually get even started. But in the rare case that it does, it would be made in Adventure Game Studio.

## Idle Forced Labor Camp

An idle game! In limbo due to the amount of artwork it requires. Has a basic playable version [here](https://tofutush.github.io/idlegame).

it currently requires:

- A bunch of artwork
- Maths refining
- A story written in the form of a diary with 50 entries, or fewer perhaps

I think I might have set the scope too big. 50 characters (150 pieces of art) and 50 levels (50 diary entries) sound like hell, both to me and the player. I should cut things down a bit.

## 嗵嗵 animatic

This is in the works, and will just be an extremely rough and stupid thing, since I have zero idea how to animate — even if the "animation" is just moving things across the page in After Effects.

## "Redemption" animation meme

It looks relatively simple, and I have my character choices ready. I'll probably start this after finishing the previous one.

## Scavenger hunt game

It's going to be a game on this site! You have to find clues scattered all over and piece together a puzzle that leads you to a secret page. I already have half of the puzzle figured out. I even had a branch ready. The branch is also public. But don't cheat, guys! Or do. I don't actually care. Hey, maybe I could install some sort of anti-cheating measures too…

## Footers

Draw some lineless art for the website footer! As many as possible! There couldn't possibly be too many!

## Character art

Each character needs a 500px lineless thumb, 500px profile image, and a reference image. Progress can be tracked [here](/characters/list/).
