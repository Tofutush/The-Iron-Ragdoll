- **Don't**
	- NSFW, 18+, whatever.
		- This involves artistic nudity.
		- Or anything that sexualizes them.
	- Change their eye color *too* much.
	- Non-canon ships.
	- Hateful stuff, duh.
- **Go wild**
	- Everything else should be fine, such as gore of any level, interaction with anyone, outfit / in-universe race / gender / species swap, etc.
	- If you're not sure, feel free to ask!
- **Design clarifications** (*they're just clarifications, you don't have to follow any of these!*)
	- The marks on the girls' faces are eyelashes, not face paint.
	- None of my characters have real-world skin colors! Their races are just whether they have ears or horns on their heads, so everyone's skin color is the same.
		- You can draw whatever color you want as long as it's either normal human color, or grayscale. My default is Chinese though for your reference.
	- The highlights on their hair are parts of the design, not bleach or anything.
	- Their ears are furry but *not* fluffy. Shorthair, if you may.
