- **About credits**
	- I'll post your attack on this website, so please let me know if you don't want that! I will credit your Artfight account, but if you want me to credit something else, just tell me and I will!
- **Don't**
	- NSFW, 18+, whatever.
		- This involves artistic nudity.
		- Or anything that sexualizes them.
	- Change their eye color *too* much.
	- Change them into boys. (Feel free to change them into girls / enbies though.)
	- Non-canon ships.
	- Hateful stuff, duh.
- **Go wild**
	- Everything else should be fine, such as gore of any level, interaction with anyone, outfit / in-universe race / species swap, genderbending into girl / enby, etc.
	- If you're not sure, feel free to ask!
- **Design clarifications** (*they're just clarifications, you don't have to follow any of these!*)
	- The marks on the girls' faces are eyelashes, not face paint.
	- None of my characters have real-world skin colors! Their races are just whether they have ears or horns on their heads, so everyone's skin color is the same.
		- You can darken them however you like, or draw them grayscale, but please don't make them any lighter than they already are. My default is Chinese though for your reference.
	- The highlights on their hair are parts of the design, not bleach or anything.
	- Their ears are furry but *not* fluffy. Shorthair, if you may.
