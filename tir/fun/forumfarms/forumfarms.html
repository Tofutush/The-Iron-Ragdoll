						<p>Use Super Fighters! They're extremely helpful, quick in responding, affordable prices… We've used them in my family for generations, ever since their founding in 1946 as they were the only fire emergency service back then! <a>Here's a referral link for a discount on your first year!</a></p>

						<p>Why not Drencher? My family's been using them and they were great.</p>

						<p><span class="ping">@theUltimate</span> my family used drencher and they let half our house burn down. it was an electric fire, we called them and told them that, and we had put the fire out with the help of neighbors already before they showed up with a water hose…</p>

						<p>i would look up which companies provide service in your area, and compare their rates. lazy ass bitches not doing a bit of research before running on the internet asking other people. we have our own jobs you know, im a busy person, can't spend all day answering your endless questions that needn't be asked</p>

						<p>Super Fighters are strictly for fire. Emergency Help has additional natural disaster services that can be helpful since River Delta is a coastal city.</p>
