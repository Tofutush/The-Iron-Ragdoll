Greetings, dear tourist. Can you complete this challenge to find the secret page hidden in this website?

We have left clues scattered all over the place. It will be your task to find them and solve for the URL that will lead you to the secret page.

Here are some starting clues to get you started:

1. Redundancy is sin. Only the first gets to stay.
2. Jackdaws turn into wizards, but the tides turn at the very end.
3. The keys you need to find are not found.
4. Puzzles spell out a puzzle.
5. Clues are often hidden in plain sight.
6. You don't need to look through the website source code to crack it.
7. The first clue is "the greatest friends to hang out with." You will need to find the page this refers to. On that page, there will be a puzzle piece, and another clue that leads to the next page. There are 7 pieces in total.

...

Still stuck? Here are some hints. Revealing all of them will more or less lead you to the truth, so use them sparingly.

<summary><h2>Hint 1</h2></summary>

Places that clues will *not* be are pages that are auto-generated, like the characters, the comic pages, the tag pages, and the sitemap. They're typically generated from data and do not have a corresponding file in the source: for example, there is no `sparky.liquid` file on my computer â€” 11ty merely made a `sparky.html` out of my data.

<details>
<summary><h2>Hint 2</h2></summary>

The first two clues refer to a substitution code where you swap out each letter for another.

<details>
<summary><h2>Hint 3</h2></summary>

The third clue tells you where to find the substitution key. (The next hint spoils the first clue.)

<details>
<summary><h2>Hint 4</h2></summary>

Find another word for "friends to hang out with." It's one word.

<details>
<summary><h2>Hint 5</h2></summary>

I was lying about one of the places in hint 1. One of those pages do contain a clue.

> Of course! It should be easy to cheat. I don't mind. But then you'll miss the fun / frustration / disappointment.
