<p>Greetings, dear tourist. Can you complete this challenge to find the secret page hidden in this website?</p>
<p>We have left clues scattered all over the place. It will be your task to find them and solve for the URL that will lead you to the secret page.</p>
<p>Here are some starting clues to get you started:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Redundancy is bad. Only the first one gets to stay.</li>
  <li>Jackdaws are the code and wizards are the original text.</li>
  <li>The keys you need to find are not found.</li>
  <li>Puzzles spell out a puzzle.</li>
  <li>Clues are often hidden in plain sight.</li>
  <li>You don't need to look through the website source code to crack it.</li>
  <li>The first clue is "the greatest friends to hang out with." You will need to find the page this refers to. On that page, there will be a puzzle piece, and another clue that leads to the next page. There are 7 pieces in total.</li>
  <li>The final answer is in lowercase, and different words should be separated by <em>slashes</em>. For example, if your answer is "Hello World," you should go to <code>https://tofutush.github.io/The-Iron-Ragdoll/hello/world/</code> (or <code>https://tofutush.neocities.org/hello/world/</code>, if you're on Neocities.).</li>
</ol>
<p>……</p>
<p>Still stuck? Here are some hints. The clue hints tell you where to find the clues, and the puzzle hints tell you how to solve the puzzle using the clues!</p>
<h2>Clue hints</h2>
<details>
  <summary><h3>Hint 1</h3></summary>
  <p>Places that clues will <em>not</em> be are pages that are auto-generated, like the characters, the comic pages, the tag pages, and the sitemap. They're typically generated from data and do not have a corresponding file in the source: for example, there is no <code>sparky.liquid</code> or <code>sparky.md</code> file on my computer — 11ty merely made a <code>sparky/index.html</code> out of my data. You can safely ignore them. (The next hint spoils the first clue.)</p>
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Hint 2</h3></summary>
    <p>Find another word for "friends to hang out with." It's one word. (The next hint spoils the second clue.)</p>
    <p><span class="spoilers">It's "company." Now, what's the greatest company?</span></p>
    <details>
      <summary><h3>Hint 3</h3></summary>
      <p>Lotus is the symbol of Fanton. (The next hint spoils the third clue.)</p>
      <p><span class="spoilers">Just look through all of Fanton's pages. There aren't that many.</span></p>
      <details>
        <summary><h3>Hint 4</h3></summary>
        <p>"Archer" refers to "Arch-something." "Seven-point star" is the symbol of Westavia. (The next hint spoils the fourth clue.)</p>
        <p><span class="spoilers">What in Westavia deals with Arch-people?</span></p>
        <details>
          <summary><h3>Hint 5</h3></summary>
          <p>Find the page that I personally think is the longest, yet its code isn't very long. (The next hint spoils the fifth clue.)</p>
          <p><span class="spoilers">It's the timeline.</span></p>
          <details>
            <summary><h3>Hint 6</h3></summary>
            <p>Who is a 3rd generation immigrant? He also went back to the country his grandparents came from. (The next hint spoils the sixth clue.)</p>
            <p><span class="spoilers">It's Pumpkin.</span></p>
            <details>
              <summary><h3>Hint 7</h3></summary>
              <p>What would you call character connections? (The next hint spoils the seventh and last clue.)</p>
              <p><span class="spoilers">"Relationships."</span></p>
              <details>
                <summary><h3>Hint 8</h3></summary>
                <p>I was lying about one of the places in hint 1. One of those pages do contain a clue, which is the final clue you need.</p>
                <p><span class="spoilers">The sitemap. It's made from <code>sitemap.liquid</code>.</span></p>

<h2>Puzzle hints</h2>
<details>
  <summary><h3>Hint 1</h3></summary>
  <p>I assume you have found all seven clues. If not, you should probably find them first!</p>
  <p>The clues come in order, starting from "greatest friends to hang out with."</p>
  <p><span class="spoilers">You should have this: mabj dp hlav tc ubiic kdipj sllr</span>
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Hint 2</h3></summary>
    <p>You should look in the old changelog for the substitution key. There are two parts to it.</p>
    <p><span class="spoilers">They're hidden in 404 links.</span></p>
    <p><span class="spoilers">Just Ctrl+F for 404.</span></p>
    <details>
      <summary><h3>Hint 3</h3></summary>
      <p>Now you should have two sentences: one about jackdaws, and one about wizards. Change these sentences into substitutable keys. You can refer to starting clue #1.</p>
      <p><span class="spoilers">Remove all occurrences of a letter except the first.</span></p>
      <details>
        <summary><h3>Hint 4</h3></summary>
        <p>Now just plug the code string in! Refer to starting clue #2, but really if your unencrypted string doesn't make sense then it means you're doing it the wrong way.</p>
        <p><span class="spoilers">The unencrypted string is "what is john le carre first book." Google that.</span></p>
        <details>
          <summary><h3>Hint 5</h3></summary>
          <p>Google finished? Plug the book title back into the substitution key and bam! Refer to starting clue #8 and enter the URL!</p>
          <p><span class="spoilers">You've come this far. I trust you can do it now.</span></p>
