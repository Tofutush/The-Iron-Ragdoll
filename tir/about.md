A paracosm about a little girl solving mysteries and getting tangled up in conspiracies, corporate intrigue, and international espionage! This website is where I display everything I have created for this paracosm.

Also, I call "pages" in this site "files" because it sounds cool. If I said "page" anywhere, it was probably a mistake.

### Content warnings

This site and its contents feature strong language, cartoon violence, and occasional mature themes. It's generally rated as 16+.

It should be obvious that I do not agree with everything presented on this site, such as the opinions and actions of the characters. Even a lot of the out-of-character content is written with an exaggerated joking tone. Please don't treat it so seriously.

### How to navigate

You can browse through it with the navigation bar at the top. The first link will take you back to the top of the page. There's also a bunch of links on the [homepage](/) that takes you to important pages on the site.

To follow the arc of a [character](/characters/), go to the "stories" section on their profile!

Each [story](/stories/) has a "Complete?" field near the top that tells you whether it's complete. Note that most stories are incomplete though, and reading the incomplete version still gives you an idea about the story! (Most of the time I have a beginning and end and just fail to fill out the middle.)

If you ever remember a page name but forgot where to reach it, the [sitemap](/sitemap/) includes a list of (most) pages.

You can also switch color themes through the toggle at the bottom. Happy browsing!

### JavaScript usage

This site uses JavaScript for theme switching, comic save / load, table sorting, gallery popups, webrings, the relationship graph, the scavenger hunt result page, and most of the [fun](/fun/) pages. It should be fine to view most other things with JS disabled.

### License

(Me pretending I totally know all about licenses) The contents of this site is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en). This thang pretty much sums up my attitude towards *anything*, really: do whatever you want, credit the original author, don't make money off it, and don't prevent other people from doing the same to your version. If something out there *isn't* released under this license somehow, I'd be a good little pirate and pretend it is anyways. (Here is your daily reminder that pirating is good, actually. It doesn't cut off any profits from the seller. Basic economics apply: you cannot make money off a consumer whose willingness-to-pay is zero.)

I'd love code to have a similar license too, but apparently noncommercial goes against being open-source? Like how come? The closest to CC-BY-NC-SA I've found is GNU GPLv3, but that still allows commercial use, which goes against my principle of "if *I* cannot make money, no one else should either." So I'm gonna tack this license to the code anyways. Who's gonna stop me? Who's *actually* gonna use the code? Right? If you *do* turn out wanting to copy my code (or a part of it), I have four things to say to you: go wild, credit me, don't make money (stay poor with me), and I love you.

### Art notice

Some character art are from other people. If you see your art here and want me to remove it / change the attribution, or if you'd drawn a character before and I forgot to put that here and you'd like me to, please <a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="https://tofutush.leprd.space/guestbook/">tell me</a>!

## About me

Hi, Tofutush here! Adult, she/her, 中 / Eng. [Other places I'm at](https://tilde.town/~tofutush/).

### Boundaries

Please don't draw parallels between my paracosm and real-life!

I welcome any sort of derivative content, like fanart, OCs, and everything, as long as you understand that they are not canon. For what is worth, the [races](/world/races/) and [creatures](/world/creatures/) are also all classified as open species. Make sure to show me anything you make; I'd love to see them!

CC-BY-NC-SA license applies; see the [License](#license) section!
