A paracosm about a little girl solving mysteries and getting tangled up in conspiracies, corporate intrigue, and international espionage.

## About me

Tofutush here. I like comics, OCs, and spies. I belong to the Cat Cult where we worship cats. You should join us.

She/her, suffering from late-stage cisness, but I don't mind any pronouns.

A good spy[^1] has many aliases. I may also be Mafia Don, Sirocco, XXQ, 黑帮老大，吸螺壳, depending on the context.

I'm a professional lurker but I'd love to make friends. Please don't be scared of me; I'm probably more scared of you.

- [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush)
- [Artfight](https://artfight.net/~Tofutush)
- Discord / WeChat (tofutush)

I'm probably on other places too, just not as often. I'm usually Tofutush on all platforms. Not being able to get a username that says Tofutush would make me lose interest in that platform.

## Boundaries

Please don't draw parallels between my paracosm and real-life, even if I initiated it! I understand the difference between real-world and imaginary, and so should you. This includes (but is not limited to) first and foremost comparing [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) to Hong Kong based on the flower alone.

## Fan content

I welcome any sort of derivative content, like fanart, OCs, and everything, as long as you understand that they are not canon. For what is worth, the [races](/world/races/) and [creatures](/world/creatures/) are also all classified as open species. Make sure to show me anything you make; I'd love to see them!

## License

(Me pretending I totally know all about licenses) The contents of this site is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en). This thang pretty much sums up my attitude towards *anything*, really: do whatever you want, credit the original author, don't make money off it, and don't prevent other people from doing the same to your version. If something out there *isn't* released under this license somehow, I'd be a good little pirate and pretend it is anyways. (Here is your daily reminder that pirating is good, actually. It doesn't cut off any profits from the seller. Basic economics apply: you cannot make money off a consumer whose willingness-to-pay is zero.)

I'd love code to have a similar license too, but apparently noncommercial goes against being open-source? Like how come? The closest to CC-BY-NC-SA I've found is GNU GPLv3, but that still allows commercial use, which goes against my principle of "if *I* cannot make money, no one else should either." So I'm gonna tack this license to the code anyways. Who's gonna stop me? Who's *actually* gonna use the code? Right? If you *do* turn out wanting to copy my code (or a part of it), I have four things to say to you: go wild, credit me, don't make money (stay poor with me), and I love you.

[^1]: No, sorry, [officer](/world/bauhinia/mss/), that's *figurative language*, I'm not actually a spy, wait hang on are you listening? I told you I'm not — I can explain — *BAM*
