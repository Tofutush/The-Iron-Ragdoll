A paracosm about a little girl solving mysteries and getting tangled up in conspiracies, corporate intrigue, and international espionage.

## CONFIDENTIAL

**Name:** Tofutush

**Known aliases:** 黑帮老大，吸螺壳

**Unknown aliases:** We don't know; that's why they're unknown you doofus

**Status:** At large

**DoB:** Feb 1

**Occupation:** Lurker (professional)

**Summary:** Subject is a human being[^1] who displays a strong interest in fake people in her head. Is known to participate in cultish worshipping activities of domestic felines. May spontaneously eat people[^2]. Sometimes imagines herself being a "supreme dictator of the entire world." Likes the phrase "it's easy to kill but hard to dispose of the body[^3]."

**Recent sightings:**

- [Neospring](https://neospring.org/@tofutush)
- [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush)
- [Artfight](https://artfight.net/~Tofutush)
- Discord / WeChat (tofutush)

**Risk assessment:** Low risk. Subject can and will trip over her own shoelaces. Has next to zero countersurveillance skills. The only obstacle to containment is her spontaneous consumption of other people.

## Boundaries

Please don't draw parallels between my paracosm and real-life, even if I initiated it! I understand the difference between real-world and imaginary, and so should you. This includes (but is not limited to) first and foremost comparing [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) to Hong Kong based on the flower alone.

## Fan content

I welcome any sort of derivative content, like fanart, OCs, and everything, as long as you understand that they are not canon. For what is worth, the [races](/world/races/) and [creatures](/world/creatures/) are also all classified as open species. Make sure to show me anything you make; I'd love to see them!

## License

(Me pretending I totally know all about licenses) The contents of this site is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en). This thang pretty much sums up my attitude towards *anything*, really: do whatever you want, credit the original author, don't make money off it, and don't prevent other people from doing the same to your version. If something out there *isn't* released under this license somehow, I'd be a good little pirate and pretend it is anyways. (Here is your daily reminder that pirating is good, actually. It doesn't cut off any profits from the seller. Basic economics apply: you cannot make money off a consumer whose willingness-to-pay is zero.)

I'd love code to have a similar license too, but apparently noncommercial goes against being open-source? Like how come? The closest to CC-BY-NC-SA I've found is GNU GPLv3, but that still allows commercial use, which goes against my principle of "if *I* cannot make money, no one else should either." So I'm gonna tack this license to the code anyways. Who's gonna stop me? Who's *actually* gonna use the code? Right? If you *do* turn out wanting to copy my code (or a part of it), I have four things to say to you: go wild, credit me, don't make money (stay poor with me), and I love you.

[^1]: Likely, though we can't be completely certain
[^2]: RIP our brave hero. You will always be remembered
[^3]: Which I'm sure is about action and consequence, and not literal!
