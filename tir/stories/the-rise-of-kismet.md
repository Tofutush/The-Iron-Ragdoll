Kismet was born in 1984 in Flower City to a disgraced, once-influential politician long since irrelevant. He made it his life's mission to restore his father's honor.

When he learned about superpowers, he was insanely jealous of people who were born with them, maddened that he didn't have any. One kid at school, however, had really really strong superstrength (superpower testing is only established after Kismet became president so she didn't have a level). Kismet manipulated her into dating him, learned soul extraction, and sucked her soul into his body when kissing one time. He had never felt so powerful, though he was careful not to show too much power in front of others, and had to wear an eyepatch to cover his miscolored eye.

One day when he was 23, he saw a magician girl about to be publicly murdered for being a magician, because people thought she stole a lot of stuff with her magic. Whether that's true or not remains irrelevant, as Kismet leaped in to help her, fighting off the crowd with his superstrength. The girl later introduced herself as Nebula, and promised to do everything in her power to return the life-saving favor.

Together, Kismet and Nebula hunted down people with superpowers until he had all five, with Kismet gladly accumulating his raw strength and Nebula gleefully seeking vengeance against those who had wronged her.

Two years later, in this fateful 2010, Kismet had all five superpowers stored in his body, his father died, and all the way in Coastline, Hyrax was crowned the new chairman of [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/). Using his late father's last bit of connection, Kismet scheduled a meeting with Hyrax, hoping to create a collaboration.

At this point, Peacock had already told Hyrax about his reincarnation from Sparky. Doing the same thing Sparky did was high on Hyrax's mind.

Kismet saw Hyrax, read his mind, processed the entire thing about reincarnation extremely quickly, and ditched his prepared speech all out of the window. He didn't even need to confirm that reincarnation was real; all he needed was the fact that Hyrax believes he can reincarnate.

So he told Hyrax, I'm actually your reincarnation, and together we can rule the country.

Hyrax was in a predicament. After a brief period of being a great and awesome arms-dealer, Starcorp was falling into the background, and his family only had one expectation of him — just don't run the company into the ground and we'll be fine. But Hyrax was ambitious. He wanted to be more. He wanted to dominate!

Two hands shook, and the rest was history (and yaoi RPF material). They eliminated political and economic rivals, took office in the last real election in Bauhinia, and thus the age you and I are familiar with begun.

The soul vault was created to prevent people like Peacock or Kismet from happening again. [Superpower testing](/world/bauhinia/superpowers/) was implemented, and the first person to be tested was none other than Kismet himself. From then on, whenever someone had higher-leveled superpowers than him, he would replace that specific soul with the stronger one. The [Magic Academy](/world/bauhinia/magic-academy/) was founded in 2017 by Nebula, a part of a series of measures exerting control over magicians, though also protecting them from the mob violence Nebula had once faced.

His iron fist over the country established, his personal superpowers maximized, Kismet had only one goal left in mind: immortality.

When it was Starcorp legend Hyrax's time to die, he successfully evaded Meng Po, only to find in his next life… that he wasn't Kismet at all.
