Harmony and Sugarcane are graduating from [The High School for Older But Still Young Officers in Training Affiliated to the Ministry of State Security of the Republic of Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/ministry-affiliate/). Normally, the first place in the grade would be recruited straight into the MSS. Harmony and Sugarcane tied for first place, but only Sugarcane got recruited. Harmony wanted to find out why.
