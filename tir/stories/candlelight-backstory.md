Candlelight was born into a humble little nameless village on the outskirts of Area 29. Among those passionate villagers who welcomed him into the world, the ones he would share a roof with were his older sister, doting mother, and abusive father.

It was not just a drinking problem, though that certainly amplified it. His dad acted like that when he was sober too. Twice his mom attempted suicide. She succeeded the second time.

But that happened later. Throughout his childhood, he played with his sister, cuddled into his mother's lap, tried to avoid his dad as much as possible, and stole sips from the wine tub in the basement[^1]. His sister told him it was put down there when she was born, and would be taken out to treat the guests at her wedding.

The first night when the ambulance came and took his mom away, Candlelight and his sister crashed at Thyme's. He was 8 and she was 11. Candlelight did not understand what was happening. Thyme told him that his parents were the kind of superheroes that lived normal lives by day but saved the world by night. His sister scoffed at him, but Candlelight believed it. It was also on that night Candlelight and his sister made great bonds with Thyme's daughter, Mooncake.

One year later, the old village leader died peacefully in her sleep. Thyme had already been training to be the next.

Another year passed. Candlelight and Mooncake had fun at school. School was great because his dad was not there. Candlelight's mom made a second suicide attempt. The ambulance came, mom and dad went, and only dad came back.

Thyme's again. He told them that their mom had sacrificed herself in order to save the world. This time, Candlelight didn't believe him either.

Their dad got worse after that. They tried to stay out of the house whenever possible; but the more "sleepovers" they had at other villagers', the angrier he was going to get when they did get back home. Westavian hospitality was not infinite, and while the other villagers did care for the children, there was little they could do about it — after all, who hasn't troubles in their own families?

The turning point for his sister was when dad didn't allow her to go to college. He had lost a woman in this house; he was not about to lose the other. With money gathered over the years, stolen, and borrowed, she left for People's Vanguard, leaving behind this rotten place once and for all. It was the summer of 2017.

The years around 2019 were a time of turmoil for Westavia. Terrorists were swarming the nation, launching attacks on civilians who weren't prepared and could not fight back. In March, a market in Area 29 suffered an attack where a bunch of thugs with knives and sticks rained themselves down on merchants and buyers. They had a multitude of personal reasons, but they all shared a common despise for the Westavian government. After the attack, they fled west according to plan.
