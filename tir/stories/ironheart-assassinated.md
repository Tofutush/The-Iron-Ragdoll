summary: Ironheart gets assassinated. Fortunately, he survives. Unfortunately, he is no longer Ironheart.
---

Sparky was babysitting [Peach](/characters/minor#peach/) at a park. Peach asked for ice cream. Sparky said something along the lines of "your dad said you could only have one ice cream," but gave her another regardless.

Animus and his driver came to pick them up. Sparky gave him a bill of four ice creams and told him that Peach ate all four.

Animus was grave. He dropped Peach off home and took Sparky to the hospital. That was when he told her that Ironheart suffered an assassination attempt and is unconscious.

They paced worriedly outside the room. Doctors told them not to worry; Ironheart was okay; he just had to wake up.

By day 5, Sparky was sitting beside him confessing. "I know we weren't always on the best terms, but I do love you and I know you love me too. I bought a new kaleidoscope for [Bunny](/characters/minor#bunchberry/). She loved it."

As if the line was a waking call, Ironheart's eyes fluttered open.

But they were not the rusty-red of Ironheart's.

They were *blue*.

## Cobalt

Cobalt stared at the blue woman and red man in front of her. "Who the fuck are you?"

Sparky would like to ask the same.

After a bit of chaos, they sorted things out: the soul inside Ironheart is a woman named Cobalt, who was supposed to be in Fanton with her friends; and these people in front of her are Ironheart's stepsister and friend, respectively.

Cobalt immediately asked for a gender affirming surgery. Sparky and Animus refused. *They* needed to find Ironheart's soul and return him to his body. Cobalt, who was used to body-hopping, just wanted to get used to her new body, which involved turning back into a woman.

The rest of the story unfolds with Sparky and Animus desperately trying to search for Ironheart's soul with an uncooperative Cobalt, while trying to stop her from getting the surgery or taking HRT.
