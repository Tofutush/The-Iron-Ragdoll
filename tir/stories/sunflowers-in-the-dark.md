Candlelight, a young and eager [SPF](/world/westavia/spf/) officer, is assigned his first very-own actual suicide watch target: Sunflower, a high school girl who paracosms[^1].

Paracosming is bad. Because it comes in batches: paracosming, imagination, creativity. The very antithesis of material reality. A bourgeoisie pastime. We can't have that nonsense here. Candlelight is tasked with stomping that behavior out of her and have her be normal.

Sunflower could enter her paracosm by flushing herself down a toilet, and exit back to the real world whenever she pulled a door up inside the paracosm. She reminded Candlelight of the time when *he* himself used to be an imaginative boy.

A Candlelight flashback: he used to doodle in the margins of his textbook. His teachers called him to the office and demanded him to stop, telling him that those stuff weren't real.

Near the end, Sunflower convinced Candlelight to enter her paracosm with her. She then refused to leave. Candlelight yelled at her to open up the door. Sunflower pointed to a tree hole and told him to climb in. He did, got back to the real world, and found Sunflower's corpse, void of any signs of life. They even dug out her soul to check â€” confirmed death. Candlelight quit his job and went back to the little village he came from.

Right before he left, he bought a sparkly notebook. The cashier asked him whether he bought it for his daughter. Candlelight made a funny face and said "yes." On the train back, he tried recalling his childhood paracosm and writing it down in the notebook, but nothing came to him, and everything he wrote down came out as boring and unimaginative.

[^1]: Paracosming is imagining up a fictional world that you have great emotional attachment to. The Iron Ragdoll is a paracosm of mine! (Well, the only active paracosm; there were a lot of abandoned ones and I can only focus on one at a time.)
