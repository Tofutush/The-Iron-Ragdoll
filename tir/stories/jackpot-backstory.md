Jackpot grew up a pheasant in Atlasia. He never knew who his dad was, and his over-sacrificing mom gave her all to him in the hopes that he could rise above his station one day. When they ran out of food one winter night, she cut off bits of her own flesh to feed Jackpot. The little kid watched as his mom bled out in front of him, the blood leaking down to the lower floors, which got him chased out of the attic.

Jackpot worked hard. He invented some sort of contraception pill with absolutely no side effects for anyone. He got extremely rich.

But he never even knew his mother's name.

He never talked about her. Only one night after he got really drunk did he tell the story to his son, [Snake](/characters/snake/). The next day when Snake asked him about it, he pretended not to understand. Snake never knew what he really thought of his mom. It was possible that Jackpot himself did not know what to think.

He had always wanted to expand his market, especially to [Moreland](/world/moreland/) where "they breed like rabbits," but as you can guess the Moose weren't that fond of someone who compared them to rabbits.

Until one day he met a certain [three](/characters/sparky/) [dumb](/characters/sky/) [kids](/characters/firecrackers/) with [a Sylvandian girl](/characters/pearl/), wanting to pass through Atlasia to Moreland.
