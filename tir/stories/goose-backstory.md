summary: Goose's backstory.
titlezh: 白鹅背景
---

Goose was born in [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/). There was absolutely nothing special about her. Once her parents even missed her trying to pick her up from kindergarten because they forgot what she looked like. Goose grew up playing and gossiping with other girls, reading the most popular books (mostly trashy romance), writing silly love letters to her crushes (there were a lot of them and if you showed adult-Goose those letters she would die from internal bleeding), and trying on her mom's makeup.

Like other girls, she spent her high school fretting about the college entrance exam, and when it was over, she felt like the book of her life had reached a climax and there was no more story to tell.

She was out buying vegetables when the letter arrived. She signed the package and stuck it right in the bag with the broccoli. She almost put it in the fridge too, but stopped herself and opened it. Sure enough, it was some random college in the middle of nowhere. She kind of expected it.

She graduated, knowing absolutely nothing about what she was going to do with her life, and went back to Coastline to her parents. (She even forgot what her major was.) She got a job as a janitor in a random office building, got fired for being dumb; worked as a waitress, got fired for being lazy; and for quite a while refused to leave her room.

One day, she saw a military recruitment ad. She was like, "wow that's *really* cool" and went to the nearest office. She almost didn't make the cut, but she did.

After serving two years in the navy, she got recruited into the MSS. Her assigned shifu was [Paperweight](/characters/paperweight/). During the same year, [Pumpkin](/characters/pumpkin/) was also recruited from the army as [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/)'s apprentice. They got assigned together as a team.

One by one these people left her. Pumpkin was murdered, Halcyon traded away, and Paperweight got sick and retired to die[^1]. She crafted her own legend by completing Paperweight's legacy.

She got an apprentice, [Sky](/characters/sky/) from [the Moreland nuke thing](/stories/a-nuke-from-moreland/), who then went on to create his own legend during the Fantoni invasion.
