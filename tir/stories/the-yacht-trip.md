Peacock's family and Hyrax's family go on Hyrax's fancy private yacht to sail to Hyrax's fancy private and insanely big island, [Froggy Island](/world/bauhinia/froggy-island/). Stuff happen.

Also Reindeer got murdered somehow so Ironheart is with Peacock now.

They sailed across the sea for a week to the island.
