Paperweight was born in the countryside in northern Bauhinia. His parents died when he was really little, and he was often bullied in the orphanage, so one night he stole a bag of buns and a bag of water, and ran all the way to the Mountain Temple, half begging and half stealing along the way after the buns ran out.

At the Mountain Temple, the master accepted him out of sympathy. He learned and mastered Wood-style martial arts. When he grew up, his master sent him to join the army. Afterwards, he was recruited into the Ministry of State Security, where he'd been working ever since.

Years later he got his own apprentice [Goose](/character/goose/) and got on a team with [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/) and his apprentice [Pumpkin](/characters/pumpkin/).

According to dramatic whispers, he had created some sort of a legend in the MSS, before Pumpkin and Goose were recruited. The legend itself was highly classified and not to be spoken of. (Actually, I just don't know what it is yet, but I'm thinking. This will be an epic spy thriller if only I have enough brain juice to write epic spy thrillers.) Paperweight himself never acknowledges nor denies this.

After [A Nuke from Moreland](/stories/a-nuke-from-moreland/), he was diagnosed with chronic leukemia. He refused treatment, said goodbye to his apprentice [Goose](/characters/goose/), retired early, and packed his stuff to [Fanton](/world/fanton/) where he spent the rest of his life in an old people home. [Paperweight's Roadtrip](/stories/paperweights-roadtrip/) took place during the ride to the border.
