Sparky was chilling in her own home, alone because [Bramble](/characters/bramble/) and Nightsun were out.

Gentle knocking on the door. Sparky got up to open it.

"Ministry of State Security," the young man said, showing her his badge.

"Oh! You remembered me? You guys were all stomping over me back when I was a kid!" Sparky felt an uneasy sensation in her mind.

"Is a person named Nightsun here?"

"Nope. Who's that?"

The officer simply pushed past her and went inside, and started emptying every closet, opening every drawer.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

"I have no obligation to tell you."

"You got a search warrant?"

"I'm not police. I don't need one."

"Stop it!"

All her stuff were scattered on the floor. Sparky sent a message to Nightsun. *Pig here, going through our stuff.*

"What do you want? I can just give it to you, you know!"

He stayed silent, still rummaging.

"You better put everything back in place after you're done!"

He slid the sofa away from the wall to look under it, finally making some noise as he coughed in the dust.

"That's enough. Playtime's over," Sparky grabbed his collar while he was still bent over the sofa and short enough for her to reach. But she couldn't heave him up.

"Holy snabbergatt you're also a mind-reader!" So that was what the uneasy feeling was. her thoughts were being read. Too bad she didn't have any interesting thoughts going on in her tiny brain.

"That doesn't mean I can't beat you up anyways."

Sparky lifted her hand, and at the same time the man lifted his baton. He brought it down on her head but it landed on a gleaming blade.

Nightsun was back, holding the baton off with his sword.

"You done? What do you want me for?"

The officer tucked his baton back into his belt. "I left my water bottle here yesterday."

"Ah, this one?" Nightsun took a dark green, military-style water bottle out of his bag. "I was planning to drop it off at your place later today. Looks like you're a little too eager in getting it back."

The officer took the bottle and shoved it in his belt too. "Thanks, bro," he said, and left.

"Who the heck was that?" Sparky asked. "What was he doing here yesterday?"

"Just some brotherly friendship," Nightsun waved her off, "friends chilling in each others' homes. Suspicious?"

"Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh," Sparky trotted back into her room, muttering, "I get *one* day off this *whole month* and this is what you pull…"

# 闪闪被抄家（？

闪闪在家里宅着。午夜阳和荆棘都在外头。

敲门声。闪闪应了。

"国安部。"门口的年轻人举着证件说。

"你们这群家伙啊！记得我不？小时候你们天天把我摁在地上摩擦。"闪闪心里闪过一丝不安。

"请问这里有名叫'午夜阳'的人吗？"

"没。是谁？"

官员没说话。他愣是绕过闪闪进了屋，开始翻箱倒柜。

"干啥嘞？"

"我没有义务通知你。"

"有搜查令吗就在这折腾？"

"我不是公安，不需要搜查令。"

"给我消停！"

东西撒得地上到处都是。闪闪给午夜阳发了条短信。"小肥猪来了。家里翻东西呢。"

"你到底在找啥？你跟我说啊，我又不是不给你。"

他不做声，继续翻找着。

"你弄完后得给我收起来！"

他把沙发挪开，想看看底下有什么东西。灰尘呛得他咳了两下，也算是出了点声吧。

"行了行了，别闹了。"趁他还弯着腰，闪闪抓住了他的后衣领，想把他拎起来，却拎不动。

"我嘞个大爷啊，还会读心术！"所以那不安感是这么来的。她的脑袋被人读了。可惜她的小脑瓜子里没啥有意思的想法。

"别以为这样我就打不趴你。"

闪闪举起手。那位官员也举起了警棍，往她头上砸，却打到了一条亮晶晶的剑刃上。

午夜阳回来了，用他的剑挡住了警棍。

"有完没完？找我干啥？"

官员把警棍插回了腰间。"我昨天把水杯落这儿了。"

"哦，这个？"午夜阳从包里拿出一个绿色的军用水杯。"我本来打算今天晚点给你送过去的。看来你有点等不及啊。"

官员把水杯也插到了腰带里。"谢了，老铁。"说完就走了。

"那人到底谁啊？"闪闪问。"他昨天来干啥了？"

"兄弟情谊。"午夜阳挥了挥手。"朋友串门。有问题吗？"

"呃呃呃呃啊啊啊啊。"闪闪嘶溜回了她的房间，嘴里念叨，"我这个月就放这一天假，你给我整这一出……"
