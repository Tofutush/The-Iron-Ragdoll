If the timeline of events in TIR will end one definite day, it would happen like this.

(The following content is subject to changes, as always.) Fanton is incorporated into Bauhinia as a special territory with limited autonomy. Sylvandia is split between Moreland and Bauhinia, both imposing stricter controls. Westavia is not piss poor now thanks to an economic miracle. Atlasia had been a near-wasteland ever since a period of massive brain drain.

Kismet, in Tundra's immortal body, died of a static electricity zap, which now everyone knows is his one lethal thing.

It's been *ages*. Every other character here is long dead. Moreland had went through countless Supreme Marshals. Kismet's death shattered Bauhinia, since over the years, the entire country has grown to rely on him. Moreland launched a color revolution and soon installed a puppet regime. The cold war is over. No one are enemies anymore. Spies are no longer a profession. And therefore, there are no more Iron Ragdolls to tell their stories.
