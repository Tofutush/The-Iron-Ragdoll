They got to Atlasia and met Jackpot and his son Snake in their mansion.

Pearl became good friends with Snake because they were the same age.

When they thanked Jackpot for his hospitality and decided to move on to Moreland, he took Sky hostage, saying that he would be released if the other kids could get 250 Moose to buy his birth control pills.

Sparky, Firecrackers, and Pearl went ahead to Moreland clutching a QR code.
