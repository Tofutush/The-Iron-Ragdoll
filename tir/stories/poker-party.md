summary: Harmony throws a party for Sky and the Poker Spies. But the spies, unsurprisingly, have a lot of enemies and putting them all in one place was probably not the best idea.

Harmony and Sugarcane always thought their teacher, Sky, was just a douche who worked as a teacher because he sucked in the field. They were so wrong. Turned out, Sky Elmwood Dazzle codename The Joker was one of the most legendary spymasters during the Fantoni War.

They found out through a book on the Poker Spies, a spy ring of 4 people gathering intel on the Fantoni and the Moose, and running deception campaigns against them. The bad thing was, they didn't know who each other are, nor did they know the real Sky. The good thing was, they're all still alive, scattered all over Bauhinia.

So, Harmony had an idea. What if we called them all here and have them meet? The war is long over, right?
