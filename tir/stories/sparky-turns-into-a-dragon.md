One weekend in April, Sparky and her friends were walking by a river when they noticed a big gate thing positioned across the two banks. Sparky, being Sparky, decided to jump over it. She managed to do it because of her superstrength.

She turned into a dragon.

She tried turning back by jumping over again from the other side, but she turned into a fish instead. She opted to over to the dragon side again.

Now, her friends didn't know how to turn her back and didn't want to. They figured out how to make Sparky spit water and started using her as a water hose, spraying everywhere. They put out a fire and got on the news, which alerted the cops.

They found Sparky and really didn't know what to do with her. They called the MSS, who contacted the Arch-Magician, and Nebula came over to the police station, apologizing profusely that she took the gate out for a class demonstration yesterday but forgot to take it back. She turned Sparky back into a human, with a word of warning:

> "No one in Bauhinia jumps over the gate."
>
> Sparky: "You have no idea who you're talking to."

Just as Nebula was about to leave, she said to Qibli, "You did this on purpose right?"

She was right. Seeing Nebula forgetting to put the gate back after class, and guessing that the Magic Academy was located right here in Coastline, and desperately wanting to see if a human can turn into a dragon but too scared to try herself, Qibli led her friends to the gate and had Sparky do it.

(Nebula got back home and looked Sparky up, finding that she's Peacock's step-daughter: "Damn I really didn't know who I was talking to")
