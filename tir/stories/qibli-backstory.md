[[toc]]

Qibli was born with magic. But her magic was so weak that it didn't even show until she was three years old. Her parents took her to the hospital, the doctors called the Arch-Magician [Nebula](/characters/nebula/), and she told her parents to buy her a wand and taught her to store her magic in it. She hadn't left the wand's side since then.

She spent most of her childhood around [Sky](/characters/sky/).

She attended [Coastline Middle School](/world/bauhinia/coastline/cms/) because her mom worked there. Which is where she met [Sparky](/characters/sparky/).

## Magic Academy

Now that she was in middle school, she also had to start attending [Magic Academy](/world/bauhinia/coastline/magic-academy/), where she met [Trinket](/characters/trinket/) and found the book that changed her life: *A Guide to Magic* by [Appaloosa](/world/moreland/appaloosa-tribe/), tucked into the janitor's closet.

The book was enchanted. The more she read it, the stronger her magic became. She actually learned new spells, something insanely hard to do because of how magicians' skillset and level are set in stone at birth.

By the time she was 18 years old and about to graduate high school, she had read the book cover-to-cover no fewer than three times.

She murdered Nebula (reason TBD) and fled to live a life at large. Trinket was made the next Arch-Magician.

## Adulthood

One day, Qibli figured out a way for other people to use her magic — something never before thought possible — and sold it on the black market. The deed was found out when Bauhinian soldiers noticed the Fantoni using dark-purple-colored magic on the battlefield. When confronted by the [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/), she said,

> Don't call me "Qibli," call me the Arch-Magician!

Which was badass as fuck.

Needless to say, neither the MSS nor the [ISA](/world/isa/) were too happy about it — the MSS for her breaking the law and taunting law enforcement, and the ISA because it's a misuse of superpowers, and also because Trinket's beef with Qibli went way further.

Qibli didn't care. She wasn't no pussy anymore. After an entire childhood of being told she was useless, that she could never amount to anything, she could finally see that she was *not* useless. She was *something*. Even if that "thing" was a filthy-rich black-market dealer. But hey, she got a monopoly on magic! Isn't that nice? She was even slapping [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), the ultimate monopolist, in the face!

Of course Starcorp threatened to screw her over if she didn't sign that exploitive contract which would pass the monopoly to them. Meanwhile, a little team of [a cop](/characters/tephra/) and [a private detective](/characters/melody/) are also hunting her down in hopes of making a name for themselves (and also because Tephra's beef with her went way back).

What would she feel when confronted by Sky, her old-friend-turned-secret-police? What about Sparky, her old-friend-turned-loyal-Starcorp-dog? Scene idea: Qibli putting flowers on Firecrackers's grave, or perhaps it was a mass grave and she wasn't even sure where exactly Firecrackers was buried, and Sparky was here, and Sky came here too, but he saw Qibli and was like "I have to arrest you," and Qibli was like "go ahead and try,,,"
