One day when Harmony was about to graduate 6th grade, Sky came to their apartment a-knocking. Entity answered the door, saw Sky's MSS uniform, and freaked out.

> "Wh-What did I do?"

> "Why, if there's anything you did, that was giving birth to a wonderful daughter! Is little Harmony home?"

Entity called Harmony out. Sky told her that she could get enrolled in the Middle School for Officers in Training Affiliated to the Ministry of State Security. Spy school for short.
