One day when Harmony was about to graduate 6th grade, Sky came to their apartment a-knocking. Entity answered the door, saw Sky's MSS uniform, and freaked out.

> "Wh-What did I do?"
>
> "Why, if there's anything you did, that was giving birth to a wonderful daughter! Is little Harmony home?"

Entity called Harmony out. Sky told her that she could get enrolled in [the Middle School for Young Officers in Training Affiliated to the Ministry of State Security of the Republic of Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/ministry-affiliate/). Ministry Affiliate for short.

Harmony was initially reluctant, but Sky told her that Sugarcane, her best friend, was also attending, so she said yes. Frosting warned Harmony to think it through, though she knew that there's no stopping Harmony.

Later, Harmony and Frosting were assigned their very first practice mission — to recruit the daughter, Jelly, of the cultural attaché of the Westavian Embassy in Flower City, Checkers.

Jelly didn't have any friends. Her dad was busy with work, and her mom was forced to stay in Westavia, so Jelly was always quite lonely.

So, Harmony and Sugarcane made friends with her.

They played, had fun, became BFFs. But soon, the spy school students started asking Jelly to get into her father's room and stealing stuff out.

Eventually, they gathered enough evidence for Checkers' espionage activities and got him deported, along with Jelly.
