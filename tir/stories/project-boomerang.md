Due to recent breakthroughs in quantum technology, it had been proven theoretically possible to make a time machine that can revert or fast forward a certain object or area. The Republic of Bauhinia is eager to try that.

So they initiated a top-secret project called Project Boomerang to develop such a thing, with top scientists Koala and Kangaroo in the lead.

But then both of them disappeared, leaving behind two young kids Jaculus and Jerboa. Robin replaced them as the lead.

The project is actually the first attempt Kismet tried at gaining immortality, but it failed. After this, he tried [kidnapping Tundra and taking his body](/stories/operation-ice-age/).
