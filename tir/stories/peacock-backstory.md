## Past Life

After spitting out grandma Meng's soup thus retaining her memories, [Sparky](../sparky/) moved on to her next life, only to find that she was now her stap-father.

## Early Life

Peacock was born in the countryside of eastern [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) with superstrength and a curious scar-like birthmark over his right eye. He had a cute puppy named Cookie.

During the spring festival when he was 12, his parents cooked Cookie and fed it to him without telling him. He freaked out when he found out, and refused to leave his room for two weeks straight, staying home alone with his elderly grandfather.

One day, his parents returned home to find that Peacock had prepared a nice meal for them all by himself as an apology. They were halfway through the meal when his parents thought the meat was a little weird. They asked him where the meat was from.

He looked them in the eyes and said, "Grandpapa."

## "Behavioral Correction Center"

His parents freaked out and sent him to a delinquent camp. There, he met [Hyrax](/characters/minor#hyrax/), also there because of a lovely [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/) family tradition of sending company successors to a hard place to "build character." They became good friends.

## Next Life

Peacock confessed to grandma Meng, saying that he (she) didn't properly drink his soup. Grandma Meng said it was alright. When she saw Sparky, she knew that she wasn't ready to give up her memories just yet. That was why she let her reincarnate as Peacock.

"Are you ready then?" She asked Peacock.

"Ready to… what?" Peacock was still dizzy from his (I don't know how he died yet but it was messy and he was still dizzy from that).

"To move on."

And the story has a closure.
