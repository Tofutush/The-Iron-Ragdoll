Candlelight, disillusioned and worn-down from his [SPF](/world/westavia/spf/) job, decided to quit and go back to being a farmer. He moved from [Area 1](/world/westavia/area-1/) back to the nameless village near [Area 29](/world/westavia/area-29/) in which he was born.

On the train, he met Curly, an extremely nervous and jumpy guy who was on the bunk below him. They chatted with each other. He found out that Curly was going to the same village to find his relatives; and that he had suffered a heartbreaking breakup that he would rather not talk about.

When they got home, he met his childhood friend Mooncake, who was also a cop and faring way better than him. Curly also met his distant relative, Helsinki. Candlelight found that his dad had went in reeducation on reactionary charges and refused to tell him for three years straight, during which his old house had broken down due to not being maintained. In addition, the other villagers had long ago sold every removable furniture at his house, including the pot of wine in the basement that his dad had made when Candlelight's older sister was born and would be used to treat the guests at her wedding, and divided the spoils which had again long ago been spent.

So for the time being, they stayed in Helsinki's.

Candlelight noticed that a couple families he used to know had similar things happen to their houses — run-down and sold empty. He wondered why. The curt answers the village leader gave him was that the old members had died and the young ones were away in eastern Westavia.
