This is where I write the shenanigans that the characters go through!

Most of these are lore dumps rather than real writing, because I can't write to save my life. Most are also unfinished and in an eternal state of refinement.

Sometimes a story will have a real-story form, if it's a oneshot, or if it has a link at the top to the real-story version. Sometimes it has a comic associated too, which will also be linked at the top.
