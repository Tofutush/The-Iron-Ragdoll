Tundra lived in the countryside with his grandparents while his parents worked in [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/) at the [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/) headquarters.

He was sent to [Hillslope](/world/bauhinia/hillslope/) after his parents were murdered by Starcorp for embezzling money.

At Hillslope, he developed an intense addiction to Ribbon's baking.

One day after pissing off Sparky, he got beaten senseless by her and had to be sent to a hospital in Coastline. There he discovered that he was immortal (though people at Starcorp knew it already).

After returning to Coastline, he tried to kill himself repeatedly without success because of his immortality. But with help from Sparky and her friends, he finally saw through and found the will to live.

So he went to a movie with Sparky. After the movie finished, they exited the cinema, and went to the escalator, but he was going to the one going up instead of going down. Sparky called to stop him, Tundra turned around to respond just as his hand touched the handrail, and the electrostatic zap killed him. He died immediately, his body rolling down all the way to the bottom, and was slowly carried back up to the top by the escalator, as Sparky watched in horror.
