---

After murdering Nebula, Qibli couldn't be a normal member of society anymore. She had to run away to live a life at large.

## Pocket dimension

She rested herself in a pocket dimension she created, where there's a treehouse she lives in, and the outside terrain can shift to her liking. It works a lot like [Sunflower](/characters/sunflower/)'s paracosm, except that it's created through magic and not imagination, and time flows normally; and because she will physically enter her pocket dimension, she cannot connect to the internet.

## Discovery

One day, Qibli figured out a way for other people to use her magic — something never before thought possible — and sold it on the black market. The deed was found out when Bauhinian soldiers (along with [Mulberry](/characters/mulberry/) and [Blackjack](/characters/blackjack/)) noticed the Fantoni using dark-purple-colored magic on the battlefield.

While strolling around in Fanton one time after a deal had been made, she got roped into checking out another potential client, not knowing that it was [Tsunami](/characters/tsunami/). When she told Qibli that Firecrackers was killed by her magic, she felt guilt and remorse, something she hadn't felt in a *while*.

And now Qibli has got a bunch of people coming after her. Sky of the MSS, for obvious reasons; Trinket, along with her team of Tephra and Melody, also for obvious reasons; and Sparky, because Starcorp wants Qibli to sign an exploitive contract to hand the magic monopoly to them.

## Post-war

Qibli, driven by guilt and regret, had only one thing in mind.

Can she revive Firecrackers?

She practiced and practiced. She managed to revive a guinea pig. Time to test it out on the real corpse.

She found the place Firecrackers was buried and started to cast the spell. But she was interrupted by Sparky, and soon Sky and Tsunami, and soon Trinket's team. They had a huge fight. They called her mad for attempting to revive people, which was "one of the few things magic couldn't do."

> "The book never said anything about magic having *limitations*."

In the middle of the big fight, a hand suddenly poked out of Firecrackers's grave. A tall boy with huge horns climbed out of the ground. He still looked 25.

But he wasn't Firecrackers. His eyes were empty. His soul had long ago moved on; only his body was revived.
