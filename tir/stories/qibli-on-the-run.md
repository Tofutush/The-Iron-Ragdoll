---

After murdering Nebula, Qibli couldn't be a normal member of society anymore. She had to run away to live a life at large.

One day, Qibli figured out a way for other people to use her magic — something never before thought possible — and sold it on the black market. The deed was found out when Bauhinian soldiers (along with [Blackjack](/characters/blackjack/)) noticed the Fantoni using dark-purple-colored magic on the battlefield. When confronted by the [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/), she said,

> Don't call me "Qibli," call me the Arch-Magician!

Which was badass as fuck.

But now Qibli has got a bunch of people coming after her. Sky of the MSS, for obvious reasons; Trinket, along with her team of Tephra and Melody, also for obvious reasons; and Sparky, because Starcorp wants Qibli to sign an exploitive contract to hand the magic monopoly to them.

Qibli didn't care. She wasn't no pussy anymore. After an entire childhood of being told she was useless, that she could never amount to anything, she could finally see that she was *not* useless. She was *something*. Even if that "thing" was a filthy-rich black-market dealer. But hey, she got a monopoly on magic! Isn't that nice? She was even slapping [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), the ultimate monopolist, in the face!

What she cared more was breaking the boundaries of magic yet again.

Can she revive Firecrackers?

She practiced and practiced. She managed to revive a guinea pig. Time to test it out on the real corpse.

She found the place Firecrackers was buried and started to cast the spell. But she was interrupted by Sparky, and soon Sky, and soon Trinket's team. They had a huge fight. They called her mad for attempting to revive people, which was "one of the few things magic couldn't do."

> "The book never said anything about magic having *limitations*."

In the middle of the big fight, a hand suddenly poked out of Firecrackers's grave. A tall boy with huge horns climbed out of the ground. He still looked 26.

But he wasn't Firecrackers. His eyes were empty. His soul had long ago moved on; only his body was revived.
