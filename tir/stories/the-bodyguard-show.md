Animus suddenly fell sick and was advised to not leave the house for a month, so Sparky has the entire month to herself.

She goofed around Coastline until she saw an ad of a reality show about bodyguards. They're looking for new contestants for a new season, and specifically for people new to the profession. This would be a chance to show off your talents and would help you get hired!

*Why don't I sign up?* Sparky can pretend to be new since she's not officially affiliated to Starcorp Security like Dragonfly is. Her job as a guard for Animus was very secret and never on paper. She gets paid from the family fund that pays everyone in Hyrax's and Peacock's families. No one would know. And then she can show them!

This is really appealing for Sparky's goddamn ego so she signed up as self-trained.

How the show works is that each contestant is given a principal ranging from 21 - 25 years old. They are then taken to many indoors and outdoors settings, with trained stunts trying to hurt the principals, as well as man-made natural hazards. Each principal has three lives. Getting hurt (usually defined by getting paint on them) takes off one life, and when all three lives are gone they're considered incapacitated and their bodyguard gets eliminated. The bodyguards themselves have a higher paint threshold to be considered hurt, and when they're hurt they have to timeout, leaving their principals unattended to, the amount of time depending on how much paint they have. Real-life injuries serious enough to warrant medical attention results in immediate elimination.

Sparky didn't know that this show was for Starcorp Security to recruit new people. She was not supposed to be on it as she already worked for Starcorp Security. Still, no one knew that when she signed up.

At one point though things turn lethal like always.
