Buttercup was born into a poor Fleaish family in [Lunarale](/world/sylvandia/lunarale/), [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/) and sold into prostitution when she was little. She received the boots from one particular client who refused to pay real money. She joined a rebellion for Fleaish independence one day.
