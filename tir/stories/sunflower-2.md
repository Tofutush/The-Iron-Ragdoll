Prev: [Sunflowers in the Dark](/stories/sunflowers-in-the-dark/)

Sunflower had died in the real world, but her paracosm world is still thriving, and she's still inside it.

Her phone stopped progressing time. It stayed stuck on July the third, 2031, when she died in the real world. She didn't know that yet.

When Sunflower died, the school covered it up and shut up her parents' mouth. Candlelight faced a hearing, held merely two weeks after the fact, and was found not guilty. He quit his job regardless.

## Area 1 Middle School

But now, three years later, mysterious things started happening at Area 1 Middle School. Things started disappearing. Small things like pens and rulers, and then entire desks, chairs, and blackboards. Whenever they checked video camera footage, the clip leading up to the disappearance was always corrupted.

The ever-so-materialist Westavians weren't about to buy into the supernatural[^1]. They investigated, to no avail.

And then it happened. A *student* disappeared. (I've yet to name her.)

## Qibli

It was 2045, one year after the Fantoni war ended, and 14 years after Sunflower died. Qibli lived in her pocket dimension, hellbent on figuring out how to revive Firecrackers, when the sunny skies of her pocket dimension suddenly started raining and thundering.

[^1]: They're not wrong. I'm not saying materialism is bad; in fact I think it's really good. It's just unfortunate that these logical and grounded Westavians exist in *my paracosm*. Suffer!
