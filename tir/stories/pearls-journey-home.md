They got Pearl stashed in the safe house. They figured it out. She was from Sylvandia.

We're bringing her home, said Sparky.

She looked up plane tickets to Sylvandia. Where exactly *was* your home, anyways? Don't know… Well, we can fly to [Bonnie](/world/sylvandia/bonnie/), I guess? Hang on. Why are you crying. Calm down!

Turns out, Pearl is extremely scared of planes and flying because that's what she went through when getting kidnapped here in the first place. It's a no-go, then; they would have to travel on land. All the way, from the south to the north.

More planning. They would go to Fanton, and then Westavia, and then Moreland, and finally to Sylvandia. They would figure out where exactly her home is once they got there.

Sparky stole Peacock's credit card again — it was like he put it there *for* her to steal — but she was worried he would freeze the card when he found out, so she decided to buy a bunch of prepaid debit cards with the credit card. She bought 10 of them, each with 5000 Bauhinian bucks. After the purchase, she returned the credit card.

She also waited until Peacock refueled the car. It was perfect. She grabbed the keys and drove the nearly-full gas tank to the [safe house](/world/bauhinia/coastline/safe-house/). With that, they were on their way.

February 29<sup>th</sup>, 2032. A special day in more ways than one.

Sparky drove. Sky rode shotgun. Qibli and Firecrackers sat at the back with Pearl in the middle. They camped, slept in the car, ate junk food for meals. Finally, they arrived at the Fantoni border.

They crossed without much trouble. Pearl's Bauhinian passport was used.
