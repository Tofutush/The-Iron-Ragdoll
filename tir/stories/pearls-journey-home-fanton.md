They got to Fanton. They had a good time there, with all the beautiful scenery and tofu. They also saw pandas. They got to the border.

At the Fantoni-Westavian border, they were told that their Bauhinian-plated car was not eligible to cross the strait without a pass, which they had not applied for, and the application process could take months. They decided to hire a driver to drive the car back to Bauhinia.

They then tried to take the ferry, but was subsequently told they needed adult company. They rented a boat and tried crossing to Westavia themselves — which was not illegal.

The waters were calm, but Qibli still had severe ship-sickness. They had to turn back and send her on land, where she called the hired driver and went back to Bauhinia with her.

Because of the time wasted on the waters, night fell, winds blew, and it was getting dangerous. When they dared lift the flap over their ship again, they found themselves at not the Westavian coast, but Atlasian.
