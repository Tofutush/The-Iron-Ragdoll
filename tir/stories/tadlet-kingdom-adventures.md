Privated the story for now because I actually have a plan for it! I want to make a visual novel (or kinetic novel since there aren't branching narratives)!

The written story is safe in the git history so you can check it out if you want. The VN outline version is *also* public in the repo lol you can always go look, but just in case I do end up finishing the project, there will be spoilers lol!

Anyways I actually do have the story in mind, not just vague concepts for once but actually a beginning, middle, and end. I do hope to carry through with this project but if I give up, I will put the story outline back here.

A summary for reference: A kid (Starry) from Area 1 Middle School gets sucked in Sunflower's paracosm. Her friend (Icicle) enters to find her. Qibli also gets sucked in. The world has gone to hell since Sunflower died and now they want to fix it while looking for Starry.

If the project goes through the actual blurb would be different lol
