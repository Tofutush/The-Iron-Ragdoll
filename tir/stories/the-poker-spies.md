  - - "Sky: You shouldn't have done that."
    - "Jumbo: What? Done what?"
  - "Jumbo turned around to see Sky clad in a jet-black uniform."
  - - "Sky: Brought strangers to your home."
    - "Jumbo: It's not my home?"
    - "Sky: Oh? What is it then?"
    - "Jumbo: It's my studio."
    - "Sky: But you live here?"
    - "Jumbo: Only occasionally."
  - "Sky was stepping around the room, surveying the place, arms behind his back."
  - - "Sky: But you sleep here at night?"
    - "Jumbo: Ehh… yes."
    - "Sky: How long have you been living here?"
    - "Jumbo: For the past month…"
    - "Sky: Then it is your home."
  - "Jumbo narrowed her eyes."
  - - "Jumbo: When did you put on that coat? I don't remember you carrying it. And it kind of looks like a government uniform?"
    - "Sky: I'm so glad you asked."
  - "Sky pulled his badge out of his pocket and showed it to Jumbo."
  - - "Sky: The name's Sky Elmwood Dazzle, Ministry of State Security."
    - "Jumbo: I *knew* it!"
    - "Sky: Jumbo, you are arrested for espionage. Minimum of 10 years, up to the death penalty."
  - "Sky pulled out a pair of handcuffs by his left hand, dangling them in front of Jumbo."
  - - "Jumbo: Um, what?"
    - "Sky: Don't pretend like the Ministry isn't going to know about your correspondence with the enemy."
    - "Jumbo: But — Wait! Let me explain! I — I made everything up! Surely you know that? I never gave them real information! I was — I was *intentionally* misleading them for the benefit of Bauhinia!"
    - "Sky: The Ministry does not care whether the information is true or false. The Ministry only cares about whether you did it. Did you, or did you not?"
  - "Jumbo was sweating and heaving, on the verge of tears."
  - - "Jumbo: I… I did."
    - "Sky: I appreciate your honesty."
  - "He produced a piece of paper from his right hand. A contract."
  - - "Sky: The Ministry is generous enough to offer you a chance to atone for your crimes, and even receive merit. Come work with us. Or…"
  - "He jingled the handcuffs in his left hand. Both hands are extended towards Jumbo. She swallowed."
  - - "Jumbo: I'll work with you. Th-thank you."

This is still very brainstorm-y for now so bear with me! Any info subject to change.

## Mulberry

## Blackjack

## Jumbo

The MSS intercepted some correspondence between someone in Bauhinia and someone in Fanton. They looked at it and just stared… Seems like this person is *trying* to sell the Fantoni info but failing terribly at that. The person in question was completely making shit up.

They realized that the Fantoni trusted this person a lot, and that they could use them to provide intentionally misleading information.

Sky found out everything about them. Jumbo, trader, sometimes smuggles stuff but mostly law-abiding. He posed as someone wanting to contact some Fantoni traders and introduced himself to her.

Sky pulled a dirty trick for this one. He asked his beloved mentor Goose to hide herself and his MSS uniform touching him. That way, he appeared as a civilian while wearing the uniform.

Jumbo met Sky in a restaurant, but quickly, Sky asked to go somewhere more private. She took him to her studio.

In the split second Jumbo had her back turned, Goose released Sky, letting his uniform show. Still invisible, she slipped away, trusting her apprentice to handle it.
