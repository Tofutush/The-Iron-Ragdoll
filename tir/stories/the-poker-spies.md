  - - "Sky: You shouldn't have done that."
    - "Jumbo: What? Done what?"
  - Jumbo turned around to see Sky clad in a jet-black uniform.
  - - "Sky: Brought strangers to your home."
    - "Jumbo: It's not my home?"
    - "Sky: Oh? What is it then?"
    - "Jumbo: It's my studio."
    - "Sky: But you live here?"
    - "Jumbo: Only occasionally."
  - Sky was stepping around the room, surveying the place, arms behind his back.
  - - "Sky: But you sleep here at night?"
    - "Jumbo: Ehh… yes."
    - "Sky: How long have you been living here?"
    - "Jumbo: For the past month…"
    - "Sky: Then it is your home."
  - Jumbo narrowed her eyes.
  - - "Jumbo: When did you put on that coat? I don't remember you carrying it. And it kind of looks like a government uniform?"
    - "Sky: I'm so glad you asked."
  - Sky pulled his badge out of his pocket and showed it to Jumbo.
  - - "Sky: The name's Sky Elmwood Dazzle, Ministry of State Security."
    - "Jumbo: I *knew* it!"
    - "Sky: Jumbo, you are arrested for espionage. Minimum of 10 years, up to the death penalty."
  - Sky pulled out a pair of handcuffs by his left hand, dangling them in front of Jumbo.
  - - "Jumbo: Um, what?"
    - "Sky: Don't pretend like the Ministry isn't going to know about your correspondence with the enemy."
    - "Jumbo: But — Wait! Let me explain! I — I made everything up! Surely you know that? I never gave them real information! I was — I was *intentionally* misleading them for the benefit of Bauhinia!"
    - "Sky: The Ministry does not care whether the information is true or false. The Ministry only cares about whether you did it. Did you, or did you not?"
  - Jumbo was sweating and heaving, on the verge of tears.
  - - "Jumbo: I… I did."
    - "Sky: I appreciate your honesty."
  - He produced a piece of paper from his right hand. A contract.
  - - "Sky: The Ministry is generous enough to offer you a chance to atone for your crimes, and even receive merit. Come work with us. Or…"
  - He jingled the handcuffs in his left hand. Both hands are extended towards Jumbo. She swallowed.
  - - "Jumbo: I'll work with you. Th-thank you."
tsunamiDialog:
  - - "Tsunami: Aren't you Crackers's little friend?"
    - "Qibli: Aren't you Crackers's sister?"
    - "Tsunami: Are you the one selling magic?"
    - "Qibli: Well, are you buying it?"
  - But suddenly, Fantoni police stormed into the room. Apparently the intermediary ratted them out, having heard that Qibli was being wanted.
  - And well, if some normal police could catch Qibli then Qibli wouldn't be Qibli. She grabbed onto Tsunami and teleported them both to Tsunami's dad's grocery store, unaware that it had been shut down.
  - - "Qibli: Did you rat me out?"
    - "Tsunami: No!"

Any info is subject to change! This story is really experimental to me (for some reason, because I can't name any qualities that make it so experimental. Maybe because it's some actual spy shit lmao) but I am pretty proud of it!

[[toc]]

## Start of the war

Sky, having no experience in wartime state security — or state security in general for that matter, being freshly out of training and all, a really new [Half-Noob](/world/bauhinia/mss/#rankings). He was eager to work with his mentor Goose, mostly in interrogating the prisoners of war Bauhinia captured. When Goose was alone, the interrogations were messy, involved too much bleeding and screaming, and arguably counterproductive. With Sky, she was a lot more reserved, and Sky learned a lot.

And one day, they captured a Fantoni agent lurking near Bauhinian military forts, way behind the frontline. She was sent to Goose and Sky.

## Recruitment

### Mulberry

She said her name was Mulberry and that she wanted to defect. Fanton coerced her into spying in Bauhinia, and she had always dreamed of escaping that totalitarian hellhole. Her first words as a baby were "fuck Fanton." Okay sorry officers I lied on that one, but I *wish* it were true, but the "f" sound is really hard for babies to pronounce you know? Ehh… sorry I'll shut up.

Goose was laughing so hard. You think you know more about totalitarian states than me? I spent my whole life living in one! Anyways, she was about to write Mulberry off as a really poorly-trained dangle. Sky, however, had a hunch that she was genuine.

He decided to treat Mulberry to dinner. Starving, she didn't care if the food was poisoned (or just didn't think of the possibility) and devoured it, meat and all. He also poured wine for all of them, gleefully clicking glasses with Mulberry. After the dinner, they each had a cigarette.

And he had his conclusion: Fanton would never hire someone who eats meat, drinks alcohol, and smokes to work for them. Mulberry couldn't have been pretending too, since her reactions suggested she was used to drinking and smoking.

He questioned Mulberry late into the night. She was drafted, trained in boot camp for a while, before offering to work for the [Secret Service](/world/fanton/secret-service/), and she was supposed to stay in Bauhinia, taking orders and providing them with the intel they wanted until they summoned her back.

Great. How do you feel about *never* going back?

The contract was signed; Mulberry was now an official double agent, promised permanent residency in Bauhinia should she see her service until the end of the war. Goose let Sky be her handler, since without him, Goose would've deported Mulberry right back to Fanton. Come up with a code name for her!

Agent Spades.

After the contract was signed, Mulberry opened up to them a lot more. Here's one crucial piece of information she gave them. During her time in boot camp, she heard that the Fantoni had acquired a deadly weapon that could kill people while leaving barely any marks. They called it "magic."

This had already been observed by soldiers on the frontlines. They didn't know how it happened, and their comrades were lying dead on the ground with no visible injury. Countless PoWs had been tortured over it but not a single one talked; no Bauhinian spy sent to investigate had returned. Like magic.

Like magic? Sky knew magic. One of his closest friends was a magician, though he hadn't heard from her in years. He had met the Arch-Magician once, briefly, [inside a police station](/stories/sparky-turns-into-a-dragon/). And he knew that one, magicians only appeared in Bauhinia for at least a few hundred years now; and two, magic cannot be used by anyone other than the magician themselves. Qibli confirmed it, and she got her knowledge from the Arch-Magician, who, as the world's leading authority on magic, couldn't possibility be wrong[^1].

This could be a lead, but unfortunately Mulberry didn't have much additional information. She dropped the topic, and spent her time supplying the Fantoni with MSS-approved chicken feed.

Fortunately, someone else came along who could potentially investigate this issue further.

### Blackjack

Blackjack was also caught by the MSS in the middle of her mission to sabotage an important fiber-optic cable line with a magic spell. Sky got ahold of the spell trinket, an innocent-looking pen. They locked Blackjack in a room with a one-way mirror and forced her to cast it. The one-way mirror shattered.

So, apparently the effects of this spell was just to shatter all glass nearby, which was how they planned to break the fiber-optic cable.

It was confirmed: the Fantoni *did* have magic. But how? Blackjack didn't really know either.

Sky gave Blackjack an offer to work for them in exchange for a proper job and permanent residency in Bauhinia after the war. She agreed, and was made Agent Clubs.

Blackjack's government official wanted results. What happened to the fiber-optic cable?? Well, they just published a news article about it being mysteriously broken and that some delinquent kids were charged for it.

Since the government official gave her a magic spell, it must mean he was a part of the chain that delivered the magic from its supplier to the frontlines. With that, Blackjack was sent back to Fanton with a task find the source of the magic.

### Jumbo

Almost at the same time, the MSS intercepted some correspondence between someone in Bauhinia and someone in Fanton. They looked at it and just stared… Seems like this person is *trying* to sell the Fantoni info but failing terribly at that. The person in question was completely making shit up.

They realized that the Fantoni trusted this person a lot, and that they could use them to provide intentionally misleading information.

Sky found out everything about them. Jumbo, trader, sometimes smuggles stuff but mostly law-abiding. He posed as someone wanting to contact some Fantoni traders and introduced himself to her.

Sky pulled a dirty trick for this one. He asked his beloved mentor Goose to hide herself and his MSS uniform touching him. That way, he appeared as a civilian while wearing the uniform.

Jumbo met Sky in a restaurant, but quickly, Sky asked to go somewhere more private. She took him to her studio.

In the split second Jumbo had her back turned, Goose released Sky, letting his uniform show. Still invisible, she slipped away, trusting her apprentice to handle it.

{% include 'dialog', dialogContent: jumboDialog %}

Thus, Jumbo was recruited as Agent Hearts.

## Deception

While Blackjack and Tsunami were away in Fanton, Mulberry and Jumbo weren't just sitting there. They were providing fake intel back to their Fantoni handlers, painting a completely fake story Sky wanted them to believe.

So how can we convince them to *stop* using the spells? Sky came up with this: since they can see the Bauhinian soldiers dying, the Fantoni obviously knows their spells are working. So we need to convince them that the spells actually harmed the Fantoni and benefitted the Bauhinians in the long run.

"With every single killing spell the Fantoni soldiers cast, supplies are also generated for the Bauhinians behind the frontlines."

With coordinated effort from Mulberry and Jumbo's fake agents, they sent reports to the Fantoni, stating suspicious things. Mulberry "saw" supplies being carted away from a station, far too many for a single station to hold at once but no supply deliveries *to* the station were made — where did all the supplies come from? And one time, an "agent" of Jumbo's saw a random box of ammo materialize in the middle of a road, and was subsequently arrested and signed an NDA before being released. He did not honor the NDA and reported the thing to Jumbo anyways; what an excellent contact!

> [!to be expanded]
> It's not all sunshine and rainbows. Drama happened. What drama? IDK.
>
> Maybe Mulberry's handlers ordered her to get a sample of the mysteriously appearing supplies.

The Secret Service believed that their magic supplier had double-crossed them, playing an awful prank in the spells they sold. The deception had succeeded.

## Investigation

Let's dial back a bit. Before the deception succeeded, Sky was intent on finding out Fanton's supplier of magic.

By then Sky already had an idea who it would be: Qibli. He had this hunch ever since seeing Blackjack's spell in action: the color seeping through the cracks in the mirror was the exact dark purple of her soul. But he didn't want to believe it. Qibli wouldn't intentionally harm people like that.

### Blackjack

Blackjack went back to Fanton with the fake news of the fiber-optic cable being destroyed.

And somehow she found out when and where her government official was going to receive a carton of spells, apparently smuggled out by some corrupt military official, whose hands the spells passed through. It was a spell to disarm people, helpful in warfare but also against poachers.

Blackjack tried crashing in on the meeting, but got found out. They didn't dare call the cops on her because the trade was illegal in the first place, so the government official gave her to the military official who imprisoned her on faulty espionage charges.

### Tsunami

Now that his one agent inside enemy territory had gone radio silent, Sky needed a replacement. He had been keeping track of Firecrackers's status ever since he had been drafted. Recently the news came that he was one of the soldiers killed by Fanton's magic.

That was his chance: he went to Tsunami, Firecrackers's older sister, working as a hotel concierge. She was trying and failing to take Firecrackers's ashes from their dad, who had apparently buried it already. Sky informed her of the cause of her brother's death: it was a magic spell. Do you want to help the MSS find the source of it?

Driven by a desire to avenge her brother, Tsunami agreed. She was recruited as Agent Diamonds.

Sky prepared Westavian papers for Tsunami, who first entered Westavia before going into Fanton from the north.

> [!to be expanded]
> And then she went places saying she wants to buy magic n shit (but not too directly of course) and then Qibli heard it and was like "oh potential client!" so through an intermediary they arranged a meeting.

Qibli was waiting for her when she went in.

{% include 'dialog', dialogContent: tsunamiDialog %}

and then something something and tsunami gets back to confirm skys worst fears. His friend had murdered his other friend, indirectly or not. But was Sky any better? Didn't he use Firecrackers's death to manipulate Tsunami into working for him? But she completed the mission, Sky told himself. I did the right thing.

### Blackjack's rescue

The war was nearly ending, but Blackjack's fate still clouded Sky's heart. By this point, he was certain she had been caught. Is she even still alive?

That was when, in a Fantoni newspaper, he found a list of people soon to be tried for treason in a private military court. Blackjack was one of the names.

Sky came up with something daring.

IDK man, i wanted him to blackmail the military official but how could he even know about the details of the transaction? perhaps blackjack got a message to him in jail. ok that makes sense.

Sky makes the blackmail of the century by going to Fanton for the military official and threatening to expose his illegal magic trade unless he releases Blackjack. So he got Blackjack safely back to Fanton.

## Epilogue

After the war ended, Sky was awarded with eternal bragging rights and a choice to work wherever he wanted to. He decided to become a teacher at [Ministry Affiliate](/world/bauhinia/ministry-affiliate/)[^2].

He also planned the covert operation to assassinate [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/), though didn't take part in his execution. The rationale was, if a level 10 magician like Qibli could deal so much damage, what if Halcyon learns to distribute *his* magic too? It was too risky. They poisoned his food at a restaurant he frequented, though it also killed nearly every other patron inside.

Mulberry remained unemployed in Bauhinia, living on her MSS pension, occasionally doing some minimum-wage jobs to support her vices.

Blackjack got a job as a martial arts instructor at a high school. She couldn't get in touch with any of her minions but she could guess most of them were caught, since she had to sell a lot of them when she was imprisoned. She found it hard to get used to the rigid life in the light.

Jumbo stopped creating OCs because she was too burnt out from her deception campaign. She sold her studio. She moved to northeastern Bauhinia to do trade with Atlasia.

Tsunami went back to working in the hotel, yet constantly grieving, unable to forget about Firecrackers.
