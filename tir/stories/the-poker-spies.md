This is still very brainstorm-y for now so bear with me! Any info subject to change.

## Jumbo

The MSS intercepted some correspondence between someone in Bauhinia and someone in Fanton. They looked at it and just stared… Seems like this person is *trying* to sell the Fantoni info but failing terribly at that. The person in question was completely making shit up.

They realized that the Fantoni trusted this person a lot, and that they could use them to provide intentionally misleading information.

Sky found out everything about them. Jumbo, trader, sometimes smuggles stuff but mostly law-abiding. He posed as someone wanting to contact some Fantoni traders and introduced himself to her.

Sky pulled a dirty trick for this one. He asked his beloved mentor Goose to hide herself and his MSS uniform touching him. That way, he appeared as a civilian while wearing the uniform.

Jumbo met Sky met in a restaurant, but quickly, Sky asked to go somewhere more private. She took him to her studio.

In the split second Jumbo had her back turned, Goose released Sky, letting his uniform show. Still invisible, she slipped away, trusting her apprentice to handle it.
