This is still very brainstorm-y for now so bear with me! Any info subject to change.

## Jumbo

The MSS intercepted some correspondence between someone in Bauhinia and someone in Fanton. They looked at it and just stared… Seems like this person is *trying* to sell the Fantoni info but failing terribly at that. The person in question was completely making shit up.

They realized that the Fantoni trusted this person a lot, and that they could use them to provide intentionally misleading information.

## Postscript

After the war ended, Sky was awarded with eternal bragging rights and a choice to work wherever he wanted to. He decided to become a teacher at [Ministry Affiliate](/world/bauhinia/ministry-affiliate/)[^1].

Next: [Spy School](/spy-school/), [Poker Party](/poker-party/).
