It was four in the morning. Firecrackers got into the car with Sky. It was awkward because they were blindfolded and kept stumbling into things and each other.

Pumpkin would drive them home, with a letter from the MSS explaining what had happened that night. Goose was driving the girls.

He fell right asleep in the back of the car, lying across the row and resting his head right on top of Sky's legs.

Firecrackers's horn poked into Sky's chest, but he hardly noticed. He was restless, thinking about their clumsy theft attempt, freaking out over the image of Paperweight's face plastered into his head, and worrying about what his parents would do to him tomorrow.

After a while he felt the car park. Pumpkin opened the back door and took their blindfolds off, shaking Firecrackers awake. They were at his grocery store. It was open again, and a person could be seen inside. His mom or dad, Sky wasn't sure. Pumpkin escorted Firecrackers inside.

They were on the road again. Soon they reached Sky's home. Pumpkin parked the car off the side of the road.

Sky reached for the door handle, but it was locked.

"Officer Pumpkin? Can you open the door?"

Pumpkin did not reply. Their eyes met in the rearview mirror. Sky quickly averted his gaze.

Pumpkin finally spoke. "What a day, huh? And it's hardly even started."

Sky did not know how to reply. He tugged on the handle again. Firmly locked.

"Does it still hurt?"

"A little." His wrists were still sore, and his head throbbed.

"That Sparky girl sure was a lot," Pumpkin said. "How did you kids meet?"

"We're classmates." *Is this another interrogation?*

"Don't you ever get… *tired* of her?"

"Sometimes, I guess." Sky did not know where this was going.

"How do you do in school?"

Here we go. Every single adult's favorite question. "Average."

"You could be better."

"Thanks."

"I'm not just saying. Officer Paperweight told me that. He sees through everyone."

"Mind-reader?"

"No. Just seen a lot." A pause. "How about Sparky?"

"Oh man, the school's considering expelling her to make their stats look better."

Pumpkin snickered. "Are you busy this summer?"

"Pretty much," Sky groaned. "Lots of classes."

"Sparky would probably drag you on that little quest with her."

"Totally."

"Got extra time at night?"

"Why?"

"You can make yourself useful."

"How?"

"Come to us every night. Tell us what you and your friends did with regards to the nuke quest."

"What? Why?"

"Because it's dangerous. You could get in *real* danger. We'll have to stop you before any of you get into serious trouble. It's our duty to protect the citizens of Bauhinia. And you can help us."

"Why me?"

"Sparky is a no-go. She's the one we have to be on guard against. We considered Firecrackers and Qibli, but Qibli would probably forget all the details and Firecrackers would tell you guys about it. You won't forget anything, and you could keep a secret."

That sounded exactly like what Qibli and Firecrackers would do. "But what if I don't have time?"

"It won't take long."

"I still don't know." The sun was rising.

"Yes or no, I need an answer *now*." Pumpkin turned around in his seat and looked at Sky in the eye. "You're helping us in doing this, Sky. You're assisting us in safeguarding the Bauhinian people!" He was nervous. *What if he refuses?*

Sky averted his gaze again. But he said yes.

"Great!" Pumpkin flashed a genuine smile. "You're probably gonna sleep through this day anyways, so I'll come by tomorrow evening."

Sky did not know what he had gotten himself into, but he felt excited. He felt like he could hear his heart thumping. He was a part of something greater. He knew something Sparky didn't know! Was he going to get rewarded at the end? Was he…

"Are you getting off?" Pumpkin was holding the door open.

"Oops," Sky said awkwardly. He got off the car. Pumpkin walked him to his home and delivered the letter to his parents, telling them to cancel his classes that day and let him rest.

Magic school was there every day, and nothing could stop it from happening.

She had to walk past Trinket near the front rows of the bus. She was starting to think that Trinket sat there on purpose to annoy her. Thank fuck she didn't tell the Arch-Magician about the book though.

They arrived at school, put their wands into their little boxes as usual, and sat down, waiting for the Arch-Magician to show up.

Today was the 3rd of August. She scribbled "2031-08-03" on a piece of scratch paper torn from a notebook and shoved it into her pocket. At break time, she slipped the paper beneath that mystery door to the outside world again.

It was starting to become a ritual. Even if the pieces were most likely obliterated upon exit.

When she walked past the janitor's closet in the hallway, she felt compelled to open it and touch the book again. Just a little stroke to the spine. Was this a part of the ritual?

The preparation bell rung. She returned to the classroom. Trinket was holding her wrist high up in the air, making the ceiling light glow in different colors, while the others complained. The Arch-Magician came back and told her to put her bracelet back into the wand box. Qibli smiled a tiny bit.

She spent most of her time sleeping as usual. The book had taught her everything she needed to know — and more. But she dared not show it.

Firecrackers got a berating for shutting down the grocery store after coaxing his parents to sleep. Pumpkin had been no help. He was stuck behind the counter with heavy bags under his eyes, unable to sleep. After dinner, he plucked face-down onto his bed and passed out before his head touched the pillow.

The next morning, he was woken at 9 sharp by his mom.

"Your friends are here!"

He wanted to tell them to fuck off. He hadn't even changed his clothes since the day they found the nuke. His underwear was sticky.

He took his sweet time taking a shower while Sparky stood in the grocery store, cursing everyone to the moon and back, and buying stuff whenever their presence was starting to feel unwelcome. Finally, Firecrackers came out.

"Alright, motherfucker," Sparky said, "we're going to that house again."

*Why the fuck.*

"To search for evidence that could lead us to the nuke's origins!"

Firecrackers wanted to roll his eyes, but he didn't want to stay in the grocery store. Might as well go.
