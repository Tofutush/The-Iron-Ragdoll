It was four in the morning. Firecrackers got into the car with Sky. It was awkward because they were blindfolded and kept stumbling into things and each other.

Pumpkin would drive them home, with a letter from the MSS explaining what had happened that night. Goose was driving the girls.

He fell right asleep in the back of the car, lying across the row and resting his head right on top of Sky's legs.

His horn poked into Sky's chest, but he hardly noticed. He was restless, thinking about their clumsy theft attempt, freaking out over the image of Paperweight's face plastered into his head, and worrying about what his parents would do to him tomorrow.
