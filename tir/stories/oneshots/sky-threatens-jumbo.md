dialog:
  - - "Sky: You shouldn't have done that."
    - "Jumbo: What? Done what?"
  - Jumbo turned around to see Sky clad in a jet-black uniform.
  - - "Sky: Brought strangers to your home."
    - "Jumbo: It's not my home?"
    - "Sky: Oh? What is it then?"
    - "Jumbo: It's my studio."
    - "Sky: But you live here?"
    - "Jumbo: Only occasionally."
  - Sky was stepping around the room, surveying the place, arms behind his back.
  - - "Sky: But you sleep here at night?"
    - "Jumbo: Ehh… yes."
    - "Sky: How long have you been living here?"
    - "Jumbo: For the past month…"
    - "Sky: Then it is your home."
  - Jumbo narrowed her eyes.
  - - "Jumbo: When did you put on that coat? I don't remember you carrying it. And it kind of looks like a government uniform?"
    - "Sky: I'm so glad you asked."
  - Sky pulled his badge out of his pocket and showed it to Jumbo.
  - - "Sky: The name's Sky Elmwood Dazzle, Ministry of State Security."
    - "Jumbo: I *knew* it!"
    - "Sky: Jumbo, you are arrested for espionage. Minimum of 10 years, up to the death penalty."
  - Sky pulled out a pair of handcuffs by his left hand, dangling them in front of Jumbo.
  - - "Jumbo: Um, what?"
    - "Sky: Don't pretend like the Ministry isn't going to know about your correspondence with the enemy."
    - "Jumbo: But — Wait! Let me explain! I — I made everything up! Surely you know that? I never gave them real information! I was — I was *intentionally* misleading them for the benefit of Bauhinia!"
    - "Sky: The Ministry does not care whether the information is true or false. The Ministry only cares about whether you did it. Did you, or did you not?"
  - Jumbo was sweating and heaving, on the verge of tears.
  - - "Jumbo: I… I did."
    - "Sky: I appreciate your honesty."
  - He produced a piece of paper from his right hand. A contract.
  - - "Sky: The Ministry is generous enough to offer you a chance to atone for your crimes, and even receive merit. Come work with us. Or…"
  - He jingled the handcuffs in his left hand. Both hands are extended towards Jumbo. She swallowed.
  - - "Jumbo: I'll work with you. Th-thank you."
