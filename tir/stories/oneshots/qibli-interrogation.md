dialog:
  - - "Qibli: Do you know what would happen if he actually succeeds?"
    - "Qibli: Every single magician in this country is registered."
    - "Trinket: Ugh, look."
    - "Qibli: None of them will be safe."
    - "Trinket: I will start hurting you if you keep being difficult."
    - "Qibli: And risk spilling magician blood?"
    - "Trinket: You are already spilling it yourself, aren't you?"
    - "Qibli: Heh. Fair. But here's another thing."
    - "Qibli: Go — go tell Kismet that. He's a smart man. Tell him, ask him to think about why magicians are only born in Bauhinia in the first place."
    - "Qibli: The emperors summoning them to the palace did something. Slowly fewer and fewer magicians were born in northern areas. Now, in the modern day, they only appear in Bauhinia's borders."
    - "Qibli: What does he think would happen if he starts killing magicians this way? Draining all the magic out of them?"
    - "Trinket: This area is outside of both of our expertise, but one thing you left out was that the total number of magicians born never fluctuated. They just changed places."
    - "Qibli: Because they're migrated. If they're killed en masse, things would be different. Do you think Kismet would risk that? I know he's listening. He can consider it right now."
    - "Qibli: I can work for you. In exchange for you destroying that magic machine and never attempting anything like that ever again. Is that a deal?"
