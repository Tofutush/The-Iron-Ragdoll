dialog:
  - Peacock and Hyrax are on the deck of *The Star*, looking out as the island faded from their view.
  - - "Peacock: What a day, huh? Thanks for holding out with me."
    - "Hyrax: Why would you go to such lengths for that girl?"
  - Peacock sighed.
  - - "Peacock: You wouldn't understand."
    - "Hyrax: No, I don't. She isn't even your kid."
    - "Peacock: You wouldn't believe it if I told you."
    - "Hyrax: Told me what?"
    - "Peacock: I *am* her."
    - "Hyrax: What does that mean?"
  - Peacock twisted his body so that he was facing Hyrax.
  - - "Peacock: Do you know what happens when you die?"
    - "Hyrax: No. Do you?"
    - "Peacock: I do."
    - "Hyrax: How?"
    - "Peacock: You walk along a river until you reach a bridge. On the bridge there is an old woman called Grandma Meng. She spends all her time brewing a special soup. Her own recipe."
    - "Hyrax: What are you talking about?"
    - "Peacock: The soup erases all your memory so you can start your next life completely anew."
    - "Hyrax: I think I've heard of that somewhere?"
    - "Peacock: Now, Sparky died with a stomach full of guilt and a heart full of regret. She wasn't ready to let it all go."
    - "Hyrax: Sparky… died?"
    - "Peacock: So she spit the soup out behind Grandma Meng's back, and dashed into her next life before she could stop her."
    - "Hyrax: That sounds like something Sparky would do."
    - "Peacock: I am her next life."
    - "Hyrax: What?"
    - "Peacock: You heard it. I am Sparky's reincarnation, and I have all her memories."
  - Hyrax took a moment to process this.
  - - "Hyrax: But you're older than Sparky."
    - "Peacock: Reincarnation isn't meant to be linear. You can be born as someone in the past, or way into the future. In fact, *everyone* is the same person reincarnated over and over. Grandma would tell you this."
    - "Hyrax: Okay. But that means you can literally foresee the future! Sparky lived through it!"
    - "Peacock: She died before I did."
    - "Hyrax: Oh."
  - Silence.
  - - "Peacock: There will be a war between Bauhinia and Fanton."
    - "Hyrax: The fuck?"
    - "Peacock: Don't tell anyone!"
    - "Hyrax: I won't. It's okay."
    - "Peacock: I had originally sworn to myself not to tell it to anyone, ever. But I figured that I could trust you."
    - "Hyrax: You can, Peacock. You can always trust me."
    - "Peacock: You trust me too, right? I think most people would think I'm mad if I told them this story."
    - "Hyrax: I trust you."
    - "Peacock: Ironheart married Beauty."
    - "Hyrax: They do seem to be getting along."
    - "Peacock: Because you were pestering them to get married."
    - "Hyrax: Uh…"
    - "Peacock: Okay, that's enough. I can't actually remember everything."
  - Hyrax was contemplating.
  - - "Hyrax: So *that's* why you were a prodigy! You remembered laws that Sparky knew!"
    - "Peacock: I taught them to her, heh. Time is a circle."
    - "Sparky: PEACOCK! UNCLE HYRAX! CHASTITY IS SAWING THE LIFEBOAT IN HALF! WHILE BEING INSIDE IT!"
    - "Hyrax: Whelp. Thanks for telling me that, bro."
    - "Peacock: You understand why I didn't tell you all these years, right?"
    - "Hyrax: I do, man."
    - "Peacock: You won't pull the same shit at the bridge, will you?"
    - "Hyrax: Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't dare!"
