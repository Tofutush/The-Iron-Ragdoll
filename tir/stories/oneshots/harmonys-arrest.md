dialog:
  - Sugarcane walked into the lecture hall.
  - - "Sugarcane: Please allow me to speak for a second, professor."
    - "Sugarcane: Harmony Frosting Entity?"
  - Harmony pulled her beret lower and kept her eyes on her notes.
  - - "Professor: You're not taking any one of my students out of here. Not in my class."
    - "Sugarcane: Would you allow me to listen to your lecture with my peers then?"
  - The professor did not speak. Sugarcane walked up the stairs in the center to the back of the lecture hall, and then all the way across to the corner where Harmony sat. She settled in beside Harmony.
  - - "Sugarcane: You still like the window seat."
  - Harmony simply stared at her notebook.
  - - "Sugarcane: You know, usually when scenes like this happen in movies, the lecture would be about freedom and democracy and that type of stuff."
    - "Sugarcane: Not, you know, physics."
    - "Harmony: Physics is practical."
    - "Sugarcane: Your grandpa would be proud."
  - The rest of the lecture was carried out in silence. Harmony listened to the professor and scribbled on her notebook. Occasionally she violently tore a page out, crumpled it into a ball and shoved it into her pocket.
  - The bell rang, but the professor went on. Some students left. Harmony sat through until the professor really had to go.
  - - "Professor: This is the end of the lecture. I expect to see you all here on Wednesday."
  - Sugarcane chuckled.
  - - "Sugarcane: So, are you ready to go now?"
  - Harmony packed her bag and got up to leave.
  - Sugarcane got up as well — but found herself unable to stand.
  - - "Sugarcane: You glued me to the seat??"
  - But Harmony was gone. As soon as she stepped out of the lecture hall she burst into a sprint.
