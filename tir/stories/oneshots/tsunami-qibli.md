dialog:
  - - "Tsunami: Aren't you Crackers's little friend?"
    - "Qibli: Aren't you Crackers's sister?"
    - "Tsunami: Are you the one selling magic?"
    - "Qibli: Well, are you buying it?"
  - But suddenly, Fantoni police stormed into the room. Apparently the intermediary ratted them out, having heard that Qibli was being wanted.
  - And well, if some normal police could catch Qibli then Qibli wouldn't be Qibli. She grabbed onto Tsunami and teleported them both to Tsunami's dad's grocery store, unaware that it had been shut down.
  - - "Qibli: Did you rat me out?"
    - "Tsunami: No!"
