Harmony snuck in the teachers' office to eavesdrop on them after her tadlet got confiscated. There were only two teachers inside, Sky and someone else Harmony didn't know.

She crawled next to Sky's cubicle and scanned his shelves for the tadlet, waiting for a chance to steal it back.

The teachers minded their own jobs for a while, but then Sky said, "so how's our evil plan going?"

Harmony immediately held her breath and perked up her ears.

The other teacher said, "pretty well! We've already completed phase one, which is either bribing or blackmailing every member of campus security. The guards all answer to us now! We're ready for phase two."

"Great!" Sky said. "If all goes well, soon the entire school will be under our control. With thousands of hostages and the security guards holding them, we can force the government to do whatever we demand!"

Harmony was trying hard to remember every detail. *So the guards are already compromised? What about the lunch ladies? Janitors?*

"Just as we planned!" The other teacher let out a nearly cartoonish evil laugh. "So for phase 2, we need to pick a student as the first hostage. Who should we pick?"

"How aboutâ€¦" Sky wondered out loud as he leaned over and grabbed Harmony by the neck. "Harmony?"

Harmony nearly screamed, but Sky soon dropped her back onto her feet.

"You were so loud. We heard you coming in miles away and I saw you squirming next to my table. I put your annoying tadlet with the gatekeeper, you can get it back when school ends. Stop bringing pets to school, and for heaven's sake don't sneak in on us and think we wouldn't know, okay?"
