    <p>Sunflower had died in the real world, but her paracosm world is still thriving, and she's still inside it.</p>
    <p>Her phone stopped progressing time. It stayed stuck on July the third, 2031, when she died in the real world. She didn't know that yet.</p>
    <p>When Sunflower died, the school covered it up and shut up her parents' mouth. Candlelight faced a hearing, held merely two weeks after the fact, and was found not guilty. He quit his job regardless.</p>
    <h2 id="area-1-middle-school" tabindex="-1">Area 1 Middle School</h2>
    <p>But now, three years later, mysterious things started happening at Area 1 Middle School. Things started disappearing. Small things like pens and rulers, and then entire desks, chairs, and blackboards. Whenever they checked video camera footage, the clip leading up to the disappearance was always corrupted.</p>
    <p>The ever-so-materialist Westavians weren't about to buy into the supernatural<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. They investigated, to no avail.</p>
    <p>And then it happened. A <em>student</em> disappeared. (I've yet to name her.)</p>
    <p>This time it wasn't spiritually entering like Sunflower did. This time it was actually physical; the paracosm sucked her in.</p>
    <p>Another student set out to find her, and made it in (how? spiritually or physically? idk yet)</p>
    <p>She wandered around the Tadlet Kingdom, and finally found Sunflower lying on the ground somewhere, scrolling on her phone.</p>
    <p>They talked. The student shared that it was 2035. Sunflower's phone still said July the third, 2031. She told the student about what happened with her and Candlelight.</p>
    <h2 id="qibli" tabindex="-1">Qibli</h2>
    <p>It was 2045, one year after the Fantoni war ended, and 14 years after Sunflower died. Qibli lived in her pocket dimension, hellbent on figuring out how to revive Firecrackers, when the sunny skies of her pocket dimension suddenly started raining and thundering. She thought she had just accidentally did that, and tried to stop the rain, but found that she was no longer in control of her surroundings.</p>
    <p>Worried, she went outside to investigate, and bumped into Sunflower and the student.</p>
    <p>They talked. The student informs Qibli that the paracosm was sucking things in, and Qibli figured it must've sucked her pocket dimension in. Qibli said she was from 2045, when a war with Fanton had recently ended. She realized Sunflower was the same age as her, despite still looking like a child.</p>
    <p>So now all three of them set out to navigate this evil and corrupted Tadlet Kingdom looking for Starry, with the characters Sunflower once knew and loved now all being evil and they're fighting one another.</p>
    <h2 id="tadlet-kingdom" tabindex="-1">Tadlet Kingdom</h2>
    <p>The world had plunged into warfare. Cat Kingdom and Dog Kingdom were fighting each other. Snowy had turned into an assassin for the Dog Kingdom, killing enemies of the state.</p>
    <p>In the end they found Starry, but the three outsiders needed a way to get back to the real world. They brought peace to Tadlet Kingdom and all kingdoms stopped fighting, but Sunflower had to sacrifice herself. The entire paracosm collapsed into a book that contained all the lore and fell into Starry's hands. The three got ejected back into the real world.</p>
    <h2 id="real-world" tabindex="-1">Real world</h2>
    <p>Starry and Icicle went back to 2035, all the desks and chairs were also returned to the school, and Qibli went back to 2045 where she made a new pocket dimension and continued to study revival.</p>
    <p>Starry still had the book. She decided to publish it, believing that by doing so, Sunflower and the entire world will continue to exist. Now Starry and Icicle could enter the paracosm and meet Sunflower at any time. They had a &quot;you're <em>back</em>!&quot; &quot;you're still here!&quot; when meeting and all. The book never sold well.</p>

          <p>They're not wrong. I'm not saying materialism is bad; in fact I think it's really good. It's just unfortunate that these logical and grounded Westavians exist in <em>my paracosm</em>.
