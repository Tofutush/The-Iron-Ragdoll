    <p>One day when Harmony was about to graduate 6th grade, Sky came to their apartment a-knocking. Entity answered the door, saw Sky's MSS uniform, and freaked out<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Wh-What did I do?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, if there's anything you did, that was giving birth to a wonderful daughter! Is little Harmony home?&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Entity called Harmony out. Sky told her that she could get enrolled in <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/flower-city/ministry-affiliate/">the Middle School for Young Officers in Training Affiliated to the Ministry of State Security of the Republic of Bauhinia</a>. Ministry Affiliate for short.</p>
    <p>Harmony was initially reluctant, but Sky told her that Sugarcane, her best friend, was also attending, so she said yes. Frosting warned Harmony to think it through, though she knew that there's no stopping Harmony.</p>
    <p>Later, Harmony and Sugarcane were assigned their very first practice mission — to recruit the daughter, Jelly, of the cultural attaché of the Westavian Embassy in Flower City, Checkers.</p>
    <p>They had been here for more than a year now, and the MSS thinks that if he was a spy (because all cultural attachés are), he would've started working by now.</p>
    <p>Jelly didn't have any friends. Her dad was busy with work, and her mom was forced to stay in Westavia, so Jelly was always quite lonely.</p>
    <p>So, Harmony and Sugarcane, faking their names as &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Pony,&quot; made friends with her.</p>
    <p>They played, had fun, became BFFs. But soon, the spy school students started asking Jelly to get into her father's room and stealing stuff out.</p>
    <p>But as Harmony and Sugarcane's feelings for Jelly grew, they realized something: if they <em>did</em> get evidence for Checkers' espionage, he would be deported, and would for sure take Jelly home with him.</p>
    <p>They didn't want Jelly to leave. They had to find a way to keep Checkers in Bauhinia.</p>
    <p>So their focus shifted. Instead of gathering evidence that Checkers was a spy, they started to find a way to force Checkers to defect.</p>
    <p>They soon found an opportunity, but also a ticking clock: a purge was going on back in Westavia. Checkers might be called back at any time. They had to get Checkers to defect before he went back to Westavia.</p>
    <p>Harmony and Sugarcane planned to blackmail Checkers themselves using the dirt collected by Jelly. (What dirt? He has a Bauhinian mistress? Tofu stop being obsessed with mistresses it's becoming your deux ex machina ok maybe they're going to fake Checkers being a Bauhinian mole and threaten to let Westavian Intelligence Service know unless he actually becomes a mole. But they ain't gonna hit them up with a phone call. Think it through.) They did this without notifying anyone else at spy school. But Sky knew everything anyways. They've fallen into his trap. He had expected this, though if they were better students and followed orders exactly, they wouldn't have fallen into it.</p>
    <p>Okay, here's where I have two version of events and I've yet to decide which one to use.</p>
    <h2 id="ver-1" tabindex="-1">Ver 1</h2>
    <p>Because you see, Checkers wasn't the spy. It was Jelly. She was a student at the Westavian equivalent of Ministry Affiliate, on which Jelly was sent to gather info. And she got them. From Harmony and Sugarcane. While &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;Pony&quot; shared with her aspects of their lives, casual things slipping through everyday conversation. All the &quot;evidence&quot; they collected on Checkers was made up by Jelly and her handlers in Westavia.</p>

    </details>
    <p>But anyways then Jelly did something that proved to Harmony and Sugarcane that she was a spy (called them by their real names?) and they were devastated. The lesson had been taught. Never grow attached to your agents.</p>
    <h2 id="ver-2" tabindex="-1">Ver 2</h2>
    <p>Jelly called Harmony and Sugarcane by their real names. They were shocked, and came to the conclusion that Jelly was a spy. They were heartbroken. The lesson had been taught. Never grow attached to your agents.</p>
    <p>Little did they know, <em>Sky</em> told Jelly their real names. Just to teach them that lesson.</p>

        <p>I suppose, but first, it's a little too vague, so it might be a little hard to find specific moments that teach you this thing exactly; and for the time being teaching them that might make them distrust spy school administration, which is the opposite of what they want right now — obedience. It functions better as a word of caution rather than a real lesson taught.</p>
        <p>Besides, &quot;never grow attached to your agents&quot; a nice little subversion of how in a lot of current spy stories the line between handler and agent is a little too blurred; and the agent could even get into agency headquarters and know their handler by name!</p>
