<p>It was four in the morning. Firecrackers got into the car with Sky. It was awkward because they were blindfolded and kept stumbling into things and each other.</p>
<p>Pumpkin would drive them home, with a letter from the MSS explaining what had happened that night. Goose was driving the girls.</p>
<p>He fell right asleep in the back of the car, lying across the row and resting his head right on top of Sky's legs.</p>
<p>Firecrackers's horn poked into Sky's chest, but he hardly noticed. He was restless, thinking about their clumsy theft attempt, freaking out over the image of Paperweight's face plastered into his head, and worrying about what his parents would do to him tomorrow.</p>
<p>After a while he felt the car park. Pumpkin opened the back door and took their blindfolds off, shaking Firecrackers awake. They were at his grocery store. It was open again, and a person could be seen inside. His mom or dad, Sky wasn't sure. Pumpkin escorted Firecrackers inside.</p>
<p>They were on the road again. Soon they reached Sky's home. Pumpkin parked the car off the side of the road.</p>
<p>Sky reached for the door handle, but it was locked.</p>
<p>&quot;Officer Pumpkin? Can you open the door?&quot;</p>
<p>Pumpkin did not reply. Their eyes met in the rearview mirror. Sky quickly averted his gaze.</p>
<p>Pumpkin finally spoke. &quot;What a day, huh? And it's hardly even started.&quot;</p>
<p>Sky did not know how to reply. He tugged on the handle again. Firmly locked.</p>
<p>&quot;Does it still hurt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A little.&quot; His wrists were still sore, and his head throbbed.</p>
<p>&quot;That Sparky girl sure was a lot,&quot; Pumpkin said. &quot;How did you kids meet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're classmates.&quot; <em>Is this another interrogation?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Don't you ever get… <em>tired</em> of her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, I guess.&quot; Sky did not know where this was going.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do in school?&quot;</p>
<p>Here we go. Every single adult's favorite question. &quot;Average.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could be better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not just saying. Officer Paperweight told me that. He sees through everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mind-reader?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Just seen a lot.&quot; A pause. &quot;How about Sparky?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh man, the school's considering expelling her to make their stats look better.&quot;</p>
<p>Pumpkin snickered. &quot;Are you busy this summer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Sky groaned. &quot;Lots of classes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sparky would probably drag you on that little quest with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Totally.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Got extra time at night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can make yourself useful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come to us every night. Tell us what you and your friends did with regards to the nuke quest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because it's dangerous. You could get in <em>real</em> danger. We'll have to stop you before any of you get into serious trouble. It's our duty to protect the citizens of Bauhinia. And you can help us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sparky is a no-go. She's the one we have to be on guard against. We considered Firecrackers and Qibli, but Qibli would probably forget all the details and Firecrackers would tell you guys about it. You won't forget anything, and you could keep a secret.&quot;</p>
<p>That sounded exactly like what Qibli and Firecrackers would do. &quot;But what if I don't have time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It won't take long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I still don't know.&quot; The sun was rising.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes or no, I need an answer <em>now</em>.&quot; Pumpkin turned around in his seat and looked at Sky in the eye. &quot;You're helping us in doing this, Sky. You're assisting us in safeguarding the Bauhinian people!&quot; He was nervous. <em>What if he refuses?</em></p>
<p>Sky averted his gaze again. But he said yes.</p>
<p>&quot;Great!&quot; Pumpkin flashed a genuine smile. &quot;You're probably gonna sleep through this day anyways, so I'll come by tomorrow evening.&quot;</p>
<p>Sky did not know what he had gotten himself into, but he felt excited. He felt like he could hear his heart thumping. He was a part of something greater. He knew something Sparky didn't know! Was he going to get rewarded at the end? Was he…</p>
<p>&quot;Are you getting off?&quot; Pumpkin was holding the door open.</p>
<p>&quot;Oops,&quot; Sky said awkwardly. He got off the car. Pumpkin walked him to his home and delivered the letter to his parents.</p>
