    <p>After Kismet successfully kidnapped Tundra, banished his soul to the vault, and settled into his body, he was faced with a problem: Tundra was 180cm while he was only 145. There's no way he could explain that away, and cutting his legs were out of the question.</p>
    <p>He had started to prepare this as soon as he saw Tundra's height in his profile. The plan was simple: find 145cm adults and alter their appearance with plastic surgery, and have them as his stand-ins.</p>
    <p>It was the perfect plan. Firstly, make sure the double's face and overall shape was similar to him in the first place; then the changes made would be minimal. Plastic surgery, permanent eye-color change, hair was the easiest part. Add in a throat implant for voice change that can only be toggled on and off by the Project Kismet control team. One younger Kismet ready to replace the older one once they get too old. Strict isolation of the Kismets.</p>
    <p>How to make the Kismet candidates collaborate? Target the lower-class and make them offers they can't refuse.</p>
    <p>And there you have it: a president who mastered immortality.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In I don't know, a century? People won't think of Kismet as a person at all. People would just know that the sun is in the sky, and Kismet rules Bauhinia.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Kismet idea dump:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>#1: Pinecone (2024 - 2044): shy, nervous, retired properly. Her kids were allowed to see her on her deathbed. Pretty good start.</li>
      <li>#2 (2044 - 2057): Liked staying up late, constantly had bags under their eyes. Had to be force-fed sleeping pills. Dropped dead one morning during transit.</li>
      <li>#3 (2057 - 2065): Started to believe they <em>were</em> the real president. Had to be shot.</li>
      <li>#4 (2065 - 2067): Received a defection note from Moreland, saying &quot;you can escape.&quot; Managed to hide it from everybody else. Shot after it was found out. It was unclear whether they had further contacted Morelandian intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
