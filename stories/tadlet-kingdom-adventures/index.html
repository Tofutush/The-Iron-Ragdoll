    <p>Sunflower had died in the real world, but her paracosm world is still thriving, and she's still inside it.</p>
    <p>Her phone stopped progressing time. It stayed stuck on July the third, 2031, when she died in the real world. She didn't know that yet.</p>
    <p>When Sunflower died, the school covered it up and shut up her parents' mouth. Candlelight faced a hearing, held merely two weeks after the fact, and was found not guilty. He quit his job regardless.</p>

    <h3 id="area-1-middle-school" tabindex="-1">Area 1 Middle School</h3>
    <p>But now, three years later, mysterious things started happening at Area 1 Middle School. Things started disappearing. Small things like pens and rulers, and then entire desks, chairs, and blackboards. Whenever they checked video camera footage, the clip leading up to the disappearance was always corrupted.</p>
    <p>The ever-so-materialist Westavians weren't about to buy into the supernatural<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. They investigated, to no avail.</p>
    <p>And then it happened. A <em>student</em> disappeared. Starry, known as the token quiet girl.</p>
    <p>This time it wasn't spiritually entering like Sunflower did. This time it was actually physical; the paracosm sucked her in.</p>
    <p>Her good friend Icicle set out to find her, and made it in spiritually through her will to reach Starry. Though, she landed far away from Starry. Icicle landed where Sunflower had always entered spiritually, so she found her immediately. Sunflower was lying on the ground on a picnic carpet, scrolling on her phone.</p>
    <p>They talked. The student shared that it was 2035. Sunflower's phone still said July the third, 2031. She told Icicle about what happened with her and Candlelight. Icicle informed her that she was dead. It took a while for that to sink in, but Icicle explained to her how things had been disappearing at the school, including her friend Starry, and now Icicle believes that the things and Starry must've landed in here.</p>
    <h3 id="qibli" tabindex="-1">Qibli</h3>
    <p>It was 2045, one year after the Fantoni war ended, and 14 years after Sunflower died. Qibli lived in her pocket dimension, hellbent on figuring out how to revive Firecrackers, when the sunny skies of her pocket dimension suddenly started raining and thundering. She thought she had just accidentally did that, and tried to stop the rain, but found that she was no longer in control of her surroundings.</p>
    <p>Worried, she went outside to investigate, and bumped into Sunflower and Icicle.</p>
    <p>They talked. Icicle informed Qibli that the paracosm was sucking things in, and Qibli figured it must've sucked her pocket dimension in. Qibli said she was from 2045, when a war between Bauhinia and Fanton had recently ended. She realized Sunflower was the same age as her, despite still looking like a child. They figured out that Tadlet Kingdom had sucked Qibli's pocket dimension in. So Qibli and Starry are in here physically, Icicle spiritually, and Sunflower's spirit was in limbo here.</p>
    <p>So now the three of them set out to navigate this evil and corrupted Tadlet Kingdom looking for Starry, with the characters Sunflower once knew and loved now all being evil and they're fighting one another.</p>
    <h2 id="the-quest" tabindex="-1">The quest</h2>
    <h3 id="cat-kingdom" tabindex="-1">Cat Kingdom</h3>
    <p>They started walking away. Sunflower explained that they were in the territory of Cat Kingdom, nearby the Royal Castle. After a while, they came to a tall wall with barbed wires on top. There was a latched gate, the latch being tadlet-height<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> and they were on the inside. Sunflower was confused, saying this wall wasn't here before.</p>
    <p>They unlatched the door and exited. On the other side, a yellow cat tadlet in a military cap was standing at the door. She jumped in surprise when she saw the three humans.</p>
    <p>Sunflower identified her as Lightningtail, a mischievous prankster who had a big brother called Jaywing.</p>
    <p>Lightningtail was going on about how the &quot;Creator&quot; had woken up. She told them to wait for a while, because today happened to be Creator Inspection Day, where Queen Magenta herself would come visit the Sanctuary. When she arrives, she would see the Creator awake and would know what to do. Meanwhile, they could chat.</p>
    <p>Sunflower asked Lightningtail where Jaywing was, she said, he died in the war.</p>
    <p>What war?</p>
    <p>The war between Cat Kingdom and Winghorse Kingdom? The war that was fought over <em>you</em>?</p>
    <p>Lightningtail thought the Creator would know everything. Turns out she didn't. She filled the group in on the history of the world since Sunflower's death — The Creator's Hiatus, as they called it.</p>
    <p>Things quickly went bad. Natural disasters were a dime a dozen. Floods, droughts, lives went to hell.</p>
    <p>That was when Winghorse Kingdom had a radical solution. The Creator determines how we live, right? The Creator did this to make us suffer. We need to kill her. And then things would go back to normal.</p>
    <p>So they launched an invasion of Cat Kingdom, trying to kill the Creator. The wall around her was put up during the war.</p>
    <p>Dog Kingdom, also thinking killing the Creator would only lead to more problems, allied with Cat Kingdom. The two most powerful kingdoms in Tadlet Kingdom quickly defeated Winghorse Kingdom, though Jaywing gave his life to achieve this.</p>
    <p>Nearly right after the war, Dog Kingdom announced that they came into possession of the Creator's Notebook. Sunflower snapped into attention, saying that such a thing indeed existed and that Candlelight probably had it after she died. Looked like it had been sucked in the paracosm as well.</p>
    <p>Tadlets theorized that destroying the Notebook would have the same effects as killing the Creator herself. With Cat Kingdom and Dog Kingdom both having seen each other's strengths, and both having a way to end the world (or at least bring about unknown consequences), the world entered a cold war. Winghorse Kingdom was partitioned into the Dog-controlled West and the Cat-controlled East.</p>
    <p>Sunflower asked Lightningtail about another human hanging around, and about the random stuff from the real world being sucked in, but she had heard of no such things.</p>
    <p>The Queen's carriage arrived, and Queen Magenta stepped out, flanked by an army of personal guards. Sunflower introduced Qibli and Icicle to Queen Magenta, a benevolent ruler, always doing what's the best for her subjects.</p>
    <p>The humans were too big for Magenta's carriage, so they just ran behind them, which was thankfully not very fast, considering the carriage was pulled by cat tadlets. They got to the Royal Castle in about 10 minutes. Icicle and Qibli asked Sunflower why she couldn't just teleport them over or some shit, but Sunflower said she had been trying to control the goings-on in the paracosm but couldn't.</p>
    <p>At the Royal Castle, a place once open to the general public, but now fortified with a moat and guards all over the place, Queen Magenta asked Sunflower if she could fix the world.</p>
    <p>Sunflower regretfully told her that she was dead, and had lost control of the world ever since. Magenta looked defeated, because she always thought the Creator would wake up to solve problems. She then told her that spies in Dog Kingdom had a piece of crucial intelligence. A dog tadlet who claimed she had immense magical power was appointed the royal advisor to Queen Emerald, and this tadlet said she had a prophecy. The full text of the prophecy had not been obtained, but the general idea was that the Creator would walk up to Crystal Peak on a night of the full moon with the Book of Creations. The cats deduced that the &quot;Book of Creations&quot; must be the Notebook. Magenta said, I don't trust the dogs one bit, but if you could not solve all our problems with a snap of your fingers, this might be our last hope.</p>
    <p>Sunflower noted this down, and asked Magenta about another human in the world, and things from the human world being sucked inside. Magenta said she had witnessed no such thing herself.</p>
    <p>The three humans decided to go to Dog Kingdom next, since the prophecy, Crystal Peak, and the mysterious advisor were all gathered there — as well as Snowy. Sunflower really wanted to meet Snowy again. She must have worked hard, spreading joy in such a bleak world.</p>
    <p>To reach Dog Kingdom without Sunflower's teleportation ability, they must cross through Hamster Kingdom, Eastern Winghorse Kingdom, and Western Winghorse Kingdom — and avoid the Death Seekers, a group of outlaws led by the Winghorse Queen-in-exile (the one who started a war to kill Sunflower) Tulip, who wreak havoc around the world, though least active in the two Winghorse Kingdoms as you can well imagine. But be warned, danger is everywhere. Tadlets are desperate. Life has not been good since you… died.</p>
    <p>Qibli was busy flashbacking to <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/stories/pearls-journey-home/">Pearl's journey home</a>, where she chickened out in Fanton. But she knew the trip was not well. However, she also knew that this time she wouldn't chicken out, and her magical powers would help immensely. You don't have to worry about us, Queen Magenta!</p>
    <p>They exited the Royal Castle and headed westwards. Sunflower wanted to check out Clover's garden first.</p>

    <h2 id="back-to-the-real-world" tabindex="-1">Back to the real world</h2>
    <p>Starry and Icicle went back to 2035, all the desks and chairs were also returned to the school, and Qibli went back to 2045 where she made a new pocket dimension and continued to study revival.</p>
    <p>Starry still had the book. She decided to publish it, believing that by doing so, Sunflower and the entire world will continue to exist. Now Starry and Icicle could enter the paracosm and meet Sunflower at any time. They had a &quot;you're <em>back</em>!&quot; &quot;you're still here!&quot; when meeting and all. The book never sold well.</p>
