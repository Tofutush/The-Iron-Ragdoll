    <h2 id="past-life" tabindex="-1">Past Life</h2>
    <p>After spitting out grandma Meng's soup thus retaining her memories, <a href="../sparky/">Sparky</a> moved on to her next life, only to find that she was now her step-father.</p>
    <h2 id="early-life" tabindex="-1">Early Life</h2>
    <p>Peacock was born in the countryside of eastern <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a> with superstrength and a curious scar-like birthmark over his right eye. He had a cute puppy named Cookie.</p>
    <p>He was a prodigy. He seemed to understand most things people way older didn't know. He was good at maths, science, literature… You know, the usual. But he also knew a lot about law, especially surrounding economic law. He even predicted the future once, insisting that the lowest age for criminal responsibility is 10 when it was actually 15 at that time; and a while later it really did get lowered to 10. His parents were proud to have raised a prodigy.</p>
    <p>During the spring festival when he was 12, his parents cooked Cookie and fed it to him without telling him. He freaked out when he found out, and refused to leave his room for two weeks straight, staying home alone with his elderly bedridden grandfather.</p>
    <p>One day, his parents returned home to find that Peacock had prepared a nice meal for them all by himself as an apology. They were halfway through the meal when his parents thought the meat was a little weird.</p>
    <p>Peepoo, where did you get this meat?</p>
    <p>Peepoo, where is your grandpa?</p>
    <h2 id="behavioral-correction-center" tabindex="-1">&quot;Behavioral Correction Center&quot;</h2>
    <p>Now that was really <em>it</em>. But Peacock's parents weren't ready to let their precious prodigy get a criminal record. (Kinda wished the lowest age for responsibility stayed as 15.) They found this delinquent camp in the city advertising themselves as a cure for rebellious teens. The fees are expensive but they scraped it up.</p>
    <p>At the camp, he met <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/minor#hyrax/">Hyrax</a>, there because of a lovely <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/starcorp/">Starcorp</a> family tradition of sending company successors to a hard place to &quot;build character.&quot; They became good friends. It was also there that Peacock completely recalled his past life as Sparky and foresaw his eventual work with Hyrax. Hyrax, after hearing about Peacock's talent in law, promised to get back to Peacock once he got old enough to inherit the company.</p>
    <h2 id="adulthood" tabindex="-1">Adulthood</h2>
    <p>Peacock searched for Amber, which was hard because Sparky really didn't know how Amber and Peacock met. His parents kept bugging him about grandchildren, so he got mad and simply adopted Fantasy.</p>
    <p>And then he found her. Amber. Mother of his previous life. That she didn't get to love enough.</p>
    <p>Then let's love her again in this life.</p>
    <p>They had Willow, but Amber got killed for finding out too much about Starcorp's doings.</p>
    <p>Fantasy told Peacock that she remembered having a little brother, but he was adopted way before she did, and asked Peacock to find him. He eventually found him, and Ironheart started living with them.</p>
    <p>When Sparky died in front of his eyes, he barely felt anything, because he knew it would happen.</p>
    <h2 id="next-life" tabindex="-1">Next Life</h2>
    <p>When he died, Peacock confessed to Meng Po, saying that he (she) didn't properly drink his soup. Meng Po said it was alright. When she saw Sparky, she knew that she wasn't ready to give up her memories just yet. That was why she let her reincarnate as Peacock.</p>
    <p>&quot;Are you ready then?&quot; She asked Peacock.</p>
    <p>&quot;Ready to… what?&quot; Peacock was still dizzy from his (I don't know how he died yet but it was messy and he was still dizzy from that).</p>
    <p>&quot;To move on.&quot;</p>
    <p>And the story has a closure.</p>
